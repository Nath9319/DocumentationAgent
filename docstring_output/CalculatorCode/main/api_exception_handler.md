### api_exception_handler

**Description:**  
Handles exceptions that occur within the API, providing a standardized response format and logging the errors for further analysis.

**Parameters:**  
| Name                | Type   | Description                                          |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| exception           | Exception | The exception instance that was raised.           |
| request             | Request | The original request that triggered the exception.  |

**Expected Input:**  
• `exception` should be an instance of a built-in or custom exception.  
• `request` should be an object representing the API request, containing necessary context.

**Returns:**  
`Response` – a structured response object that includes an error message and status code.

**Detailed Logic:**  
• Captures the exception details and logs them for debugging purposes.  
• Constructs a response object that includes an appropriate HTTP status code based on the type of exception.  
• Returns the response object to the client, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.

**Raises / Errors:**  
• May raise a `ValueError` if the exception type is unrecognized.  
• Logs any issues encountered during the logging process.

**Usage Example:**  
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    response = api_exception_handler(e, request)
```
