### TTestInput

**Description:**  
Model for an independent t-test. Validates that samples are not identical.

**Parameters:**  
| Name      | Type   | Description                                 |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| samples_a | list   | First sample data for the t-test.          |
| samples_b | list   | Second sample data for the t-test.         |

**Expected Input:**  
• `samples_a` and `samples_b` must be lists containing numerical values.  
• The lengths of `samples_a` and `samples_b` should be greater than 1.  
• The samples must not be identical; they should have at least one differing value.

**Returns:**  
`bool` – indicates whether the samples are valid for performing an independent t-test.

**Detailed Logic:**  
• The model checks the lengths of both sample lists to ensure they contain more than one element.  
• It then compares the two samples to confirm that they are not identical.  
• If the samples pass these validations, the model allows for further statistical analysis; otherwise, it raises an error.

**Raises / Errors:**  
• Raises a `ValueError` if the samples are identical or if either sample has fewer than two elements.

**Usage Example:**  
```python
t_test_input = TTestInput(samples_a=[1, 2, 3], samples_b=[4, 5, 6])
is_valid = t_test_input.validate()  # Returns True if samples are valid
```
