### ListInput

**Description:**  
Model for operations on a list of numbers.

**Parameters / Attributes:**  
| Name       | Type   | Description                           |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| numbers    | list   | A list of numerical values to operate on. |

**Expected Input:**  
• `numbers` should be a list containing numeric types (e.g., integers or floats).  
• The list may be empty, but operations on an empty list should be handled gracefully.  
• All elements in the list should be of compatible types for the intended operations (e.g., all should be numbers).

**Returns:**  
The specific return type and meaning depend on the operations performed on the list, which are not detailed in the docstring.

**Detailed Logic:**  
• The class likely includes methods to perform various operations on the list of numbers, such as addition, subtraction, or other mathematical computations.  
• Each method would iterate over the `numbers` list to apply the respective operation, returning the result based on the operation's logic.  
• If the list is empty, the methods should include checks to prevent errors and return appropriate values or messages.

**Raises / Errors:**  
• Potential exceptions may arise from invalid input types or operations that are not defined for the given list (e.g., division by zero if applicable).  
• The class should handle these exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages.

**Usage Example:**  
```python
list_input = ListInput([1, 2, 3, 4])
result = list_input.some_operation()  # Replace with actual method name
print(result)
```
