### DualInput

**Description:**  
Model for operations requiring two numbers. This class serves as a foundational structure for calculations that involve two input values, enabling various mathematical operations.

**Parameters / Attributes:**  
| Name      | Type   | Description                                   |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| input1    | float  | The first number for the operation.           |
| input2    | float  | The second number for the operation.          |

**Expected Input:**  
• `input1` and `input2` should be numeric values (e.g., integers or floats).  
• Both inputs can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the operation being performed.

**Returns:**  
The class does not have a direct return value as it is a model; however, it facilitates operations that will return results based on the two inputs.

**Detailed Logic:**  
• The class initializes with two numeric inputs.  
• It provides a structure for methods that will perform operations using these inputs, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.  
• Each method will utilize the two attributes (`input1` and `input2`) to compute the result of the specified operation.

**Usage Example:**  
```python
# Create an instance of DualInput
dual_input = DualInput(input1=5, input2=10)

# Example operation (assuming methods are defined)
result = dual_input.add()  # This would return 15 if an add method is implemented
```
