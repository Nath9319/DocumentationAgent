### create_sample_database()

**Description:**  
Creates a sample SQLite database from a sample CSV file. The script first generates a CSV file with sample housing data, then creates a SQLite database and populates a table with that data.

**Parameters:**  
| Name           | Type   | Description                                           |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| None           | N/A    | This function does not take any parameters.          |

**Expected Input:**  
• The function generates a CSV file internally, so no external input is required.  
• The generated CSV file contains sample housing data, which is used to populate the database.

**Returns:**  
`None` – This function does not return a value.

**Detailed Logic:**  
1. The script begins by generating a CSV file containing sample housing data.
2. It defines the structure of the SQLite database and the table to be created.
3. The script establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
4. It reads the generated CSV file and inserts the data into the designated table.
5. Finally, the connection to the database is closed, completing the database creation and population process.

**Raises / Errors:**  
• Potential errors may arise from file handling, such as inability to create or write to the CSV file.  
• Database errors may occur if the SQLite database cannot be created or if there are issues with data insertion.

**Usage Example:**  
```python
create_sample_database()
```  
This example demonstrates how to call the function to create and populate the sample database.
