### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `DataError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing or validation within the application. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `DataError` class, allowing for the inclusion of a specific error message that describes the nature of the data-related issue.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A string that provides a detailed description of the error encountered. This message is intended to inform the user or developer about the specific data issue.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that clearly articulates the data error. It is expected to be non-empty to ensure that the error context is adequately conveyed.

**Returns:**
None: The `__init__` method does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, which typically includes setting up the exception message in the base exception class.
- By passing the `message` parameter to the superclass, the `DataError` instance is equipped with a descriptive error message that can be accessed when the exception is raised.
- This method serves as the foundational setup for the `DataError` class, enabling it to be raised with context-specific information when data-related issues occur in the application.
