# Documentation for `DataError.__init__`

### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `DataError.__init__` method is a constructor for the `DataError` class, which is likely a custom exception used to signal issues related to data processing or validation within the application. This method initializes the exception object, allowing for the inclusion of a specific error message or additional context when the exception is raised.

**Parameters:**
- `self` (`DataError`): The instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`, optional): A string that provides a description of the error. This parameter is typically used to convey specific details about the nature of the data error.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that describes the error encountered. If no message is provided, it defaults to a generic error message. The input string can be empty but should ideally contain relevant information to aid in debugging.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return a value. Instead, it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the exception hierarchy.
- The `message` parameter is then passed to the superclass's `__init__` method, allowing the base exception class to store the error message. This message can later be retrieved when the exception is caught, providing context about the error that occurred.
- Overall, this constructor sets up the necessary attributes for the `DataError` instance, enabling it to function as a meaningful exception within the application.
