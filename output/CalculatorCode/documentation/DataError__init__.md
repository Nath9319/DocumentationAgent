### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `DataError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. This class extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling related to data issues.

**Parameters:**
- `self` (`DataError`): The instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`, optional): A descriptive message that provides details about the error. This message is passed to the base exception class.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter is expected to be a string that describes the nature of the data error. If no message is provided, the default behavior of the base exception class will apply.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes an instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass (likely `Exception`) using `super()`. This ensures that the base class is properly initialized with any necessary attributes or state.
- The optional `message` parameter is passed to the superclass's constructor, allowing the error message to be stored and later retrieved when the exception is raised.
- This method sets up the `DataError` instance to be used in exception handling, providing a clear and specific error message related to data issues encountered in the application.
