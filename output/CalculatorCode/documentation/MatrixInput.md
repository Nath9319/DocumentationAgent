### MatrixInput

**Description:**
`MatrixInput` is a model designed for handling matrix operations within the application. It incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure that the input matrices conform to specified criteria, and it provides a helper function to facilitate matrix-related tasks. This class is built upon the `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational features to enhance functionality.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `matrix` (`np.array`): This attribute holds the matrix data as a NumPy array. It is the primary data structure for matrix operations and is subject to validation.
  - Additional attributes may be defined within the class, but specific details are not provided.

**Expected Input:**
- The `matrix` attribute is expected to be a NumPy array. The input should adhere to the following constraints:
  - The matrix should be two-dimensional (i.e., it must have rows and columns).
  - The data type of the elements within the matrix should be numeric (e.g., integers or floats).
  - Validation checks may enforce specific dimensions or properties, depending on the implementation.

**Returns:**
- The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that can be used for further matrix operations and validations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `MatrixInput` class utilizes the `BaseModel` to inherit common functionalities and properties.
- The class likely employs the `Field` and `field_validator` from the external libraries to define and validate the `matrix` attribute. This ensures that any matrix assigned to the attribute meets the required specifications.
- The helper function within the class is designed to perform specific matrix operations, although the exact nature of these operations is not detailed in the provided information.
- The class interacts with NumPy (`np.array`) to facilitate efficient matrix manipulations, leveraging its capabilities for mathematical operations and data handling.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `MatrixInput` class, outlining its purpose, expected behavior, and the underlying logic that governs its functionality.
