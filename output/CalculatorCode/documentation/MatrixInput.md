### MatrixInput

**Description:**
The `MatrixInput` class serves as a model for handling matrix operations within the application. It incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure that the matrices conform to specified requirements and includes a helper function to facilitate matrix-related tasks.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `matrix` (`np.array`): A NumPy array representing the matrix data. This attribute is essential for performing matrix operations and must adhere to the validation rules defined within the class.
  - Additional attributes may be defined for validation purposes, but specific details are not provided in the context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `matrix` attribute should be a NumPy array. It is expected to meet certain validation criteria, such as dimensions and data types, which are enforced by the class's internal validators. The exact constraints are not specified but typically involve checks for non-empty arrays and appropriate numerical types.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes the matrix and sets up the necessary validation mechanisms.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon creation of an instance of `MatrixInput`, the class initializes its attributes, particularly the `matrix`.
- The class utilizes validators, likely defined through the `field_validator` from the external library, to ensure that the input matrix meets the required specifications. This may include checks for shape, data type, and other properties relevant to matrix operations.
- The helper function included in the class is designed to assist with common matrix tasks, although the specific functionality of this helper function is not detailed in the provided context.
- The class inherits from `BaseModel`, which may provide additional functionality or structure for model validation and data handling, although specifics are not elaborated upon in the context. 

Overall, `MatrixInput` is structured to facilitate robust matrix handling while ensuring that all inputs are validated according to predefined rules, thereby enhancing the reliability of matrix operations within the application.
