### DataService.get_series_from_file(file: Any, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a CSV file, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is designed to facilitate data extraction from CSV files, enabling users to easily access specific data columns for further analysis or processing.

**Parameters:**
- `file` (`Any`): The file object representing the CSV file to be read. This should be a file-like object that supports reading operations.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to extract from the CSV file. This should match one of the column headers in the CSV.

**Expected Input:**
- The `file` parameter should be a valid file-like object that can be read, such as one obtained from an upload or a file path that has been opened in read mode.
- The `column_name` should be a string that corresponds to an existing column in the CSV file. If the column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column of the CSV file. If the column is not found, a `DataError` will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by checking if the provided `file` ends with a `.csv` extension to ensure it is a valid CSV file.
- It then reads the content of the file into a pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv` function.
- After loading the DataFrame, the method checks if the specified `column_name` exists within the DataFrame's columns.
- If the column exists, it extracts the data from that column and returns it as a pandas Series.
- If the column does not exist, the method raises a `DataError`, indicating that the requested column could not be found, thus providing clear feedback regarding the nature of the error. 

This method is essential for applications that require dynamic data extraction from CSV files, ensuring that users can retrieve specific datasets efficiently while handling potential errors gracefully.
