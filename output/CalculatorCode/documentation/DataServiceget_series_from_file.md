# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_file`

### DataService.get_series_from_file(file: Any, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a CSV file, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is useful for data processing tasks where specific data columns need to be isolated for analysis or manipulation.

**Parameters:**
- `file` (`Any`): The file object representing the CSV file to be read. This object should support methods for reading its content.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to extract from the CSV file. This should match one of the column headers in the CSV.

**Expected Input:**
- The `file` parameter should be a valid file-like object that can be read, such as one obtained from an open file operation or a file upload in a web application.
- The `column_name` should be a string that corresponds to a valid column header in the CSV file. If the column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column of the CSV file. If the column is not found, a `DataError` will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks if the provided file has a valid CSV format by verifying its filename extension.
- It then reads the content of the file using the `read` method, decoding it as necessary to handle text data.
- The content is processed using `pd.read_csv` to create a DataFrame, which allows for easy manipulation of tabular data.
- The method checks if the specified `column_name` exists in the DataFrame's columns. If it does, the corresponding data is extracted and returned as a pandas Series.
- If the column is not found, a `DataError` is raised, providing a clear indication of the issue for debugging purposes. This custom exception enhances error handling by allowing the caller to specifically catch data-related errors.
