### DataService.get_series_from_file(file: UploadFile, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a CSV file provided as an `UploadFile`, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is useful for processing data files uploaded by users, allowing for easy access to specific data columns for further analysis or manipulation.

**Parameters:**
- `file` (`UploadFile`): An object representing the uploaded CSV file. This should be a valid CSV format that can be read by pandas.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to be extracted from the CSV file. This should match one of the column headers in the CSV.

**Expected Input:**
- The `file` parameter must be a valid `UploadFile` object containing CSV data.
- The `column_name` should be a string that corresponds to an existing column in the CSV file. If the specified column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column of the CSV file. If the column is not found, a `DataError` will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by reading the contents of the provided CSV file using the `pd.read_csv` function, which loads the data into a pandas DataFrame.
- It then checks if the specified `column_name` exists within the DataFrame's columns. If the column is found, it extracts the data from that column and converts it into a pandas Series.
- If the column does not exist, the method raises a `DataError`, indicating that the requested column could not be found in the uploaded file.
- This method leverages the capabilities of the pandas library for data manipulation and the `DataError` class for error handling, ensuring that users receive clear feedback when issues arise during data extraction.
