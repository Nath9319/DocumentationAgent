### FinancialService.calculate_payment(principal: float, annual_rate: float, num_payments: int) -> float

**Description:**
The `calculate_payment` method computes the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan over a specified number of payments. It utilizes the net present value formula to determine the payment amount based on the loan's principal, annual interest rate, and the total number of payments.

**Parameters:**
- `principal` (`float`): The total amount of the loan that needs to be repaid.
- `annual_rate` (`float`): The annual interest rate expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
- `num_payments` (`int`): The total number of payments to be made over the life of the loan.

**Expected Input:**
- `principal` must be a positive float, indicating the loan amount.
- `annual_rate` should be a non-negative float, where a value of 0.0 indicates no interest.
- `num_payments` must be a positive integer, representing the number of payment periods.

**Returns:**
`float`: The fixed payment amount that must be paid in each period to fully amortize the loan.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks if the `annual_rate` is zero. If it is, the function calculates the payment by dividing the `principal` evenly across all `num_payments`.
- If the `annual_rate` is greater than zero, it converts the annual rate to a monthly interest rate by dividing it by 12.
- The method then applies the standard amortization formula, which incorporates the principal, the monthly interest rate, and the number of payments to compute the periodic payment amount.
- The calculation relies on the `npf.pmt` function from the external library, which simplifies the computation of the payment based on the provided parameters. This function handles the financial calculations internally, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
