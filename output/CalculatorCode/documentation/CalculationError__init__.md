# Documentation for `CalculationError.__init__`

### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur during calculation processes within the application. This constructor initializes the exception with a specific message that can provide context about the error encountered.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A string that describes the error in detail. This message is intended to provide insight into what went wrong during the calculation.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that conveys the nature of the calculation error. It is expected to be informative enough to assist in debugging or understanding the issue.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass (likely `Exception` or a similar base class) using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that the base class is properly initialized with the provided error message.
- By doing so, it leverages the built-in exception handling mechanisms of Python, allowing the `CalculationError` to behave like a standard exception while still providing additional context specific to calculation errors.
