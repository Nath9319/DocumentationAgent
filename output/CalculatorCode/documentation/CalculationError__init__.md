### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError.__init__` method is a constructor for the `CalculationError` class, which is a custom exception used to signal errors that occur during calculations in the application. This method initializes the exception with a specific message and any additional attributes necessary for error handling.

**Parameters:**
- `self` (`CalculationError`): The instance of the `CalculationError` class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the error encountered during a calculation. This message is intended to help the user understand the nature of the error.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that clearly describes the error. It is expected to be non-empty to ensure that the error context is communicated effectively.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `CalculationError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that the base exception class is properly initialized with the provided error message.
- By leveraging the parent class's initialization, `CalculationError` inherits all the standard behaviors of Python exceptions, including the ability to be raised and caught in try-except blocks.
- The `message` parameter is crucial as it allows the exception to convey specific information about the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
