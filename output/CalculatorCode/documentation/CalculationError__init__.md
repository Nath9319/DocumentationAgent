### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError.__init__` method is a constructor for the `CalculationError` class, which is designed to handle exceptions related to calculation errors within the application. This method initializes an instance of the `CalculationError` class, allowing for the encapsulation of error messages and other relevant information when a calculation fails.

**Parameters:**
- `self` (`CalculationError`): The instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`, optional): A string that describes the error encountered during a calculation. This parameter is typically used to provide context or details about the specific error.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter is expected to be a string that conveys the nature of the calculation error. If no message is provided, it defaults to `None`.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return a value. Instead, it initializes the instance of the `CalculationError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the constructor of the parent class using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `CalculationError` to inherit properties and behaviors from its superclass.
- The `message` parameter, if provided, is passed to the parent class constructor, which may handle it in a way that is consistent with the error handling framework of the application.
- This method does not contain any additional logic beyond the initialization process, as its primary role is to set up the error object for use in exception handling scenarios.
