### calculate_descriptive_stats(numbers: list) -> dict

**Description:**
Calculates descriptive statistics for a given list of numbers. This method computes key statistical measures including the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, and returns these values in a structured dictionary format.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a non-empty list containing numeric data types (int or float). The list can contain duplicate values, as the mode calculation will handle this appropriately. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return an empty dictionary, depending on the implementation.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following key-value pairs:
- `mean`: The average of the numbers.
- `median`: The middle value when the numbers are sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring number(s) in the list.
- `variance`: A measure of how much the numbers vary from the mean.
- `standard_deviation`: The square root of the variance, representing the dispersion of the numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input list to ensure it is not empty.
- It then utilizes the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library to calculate the mean of the numbers.
- Next, it employs `np.median` to find the median value.
- For the mode, the function calls `stats.mode` from the SciPy library, which returns the most common value(s) in the list.
- The variance is computed using `np.var`, which assesses the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- Finally, the standard deviation is calculated using `np.std`, providing insight into the spread of the data.
- All computed statistics are organized into a dictionary and returned to the caller, allowing for easy access to the statistical measures.
