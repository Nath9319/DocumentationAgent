### calculate_descriptive_stats(numbers: list) -> dict

**Description:**
Calculates descriptive statistics for a given list of numerical values. The function computes the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of the input list, returning these statistics in a structured dictionary format.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numeric values. The list can be of any length, but it must contain at least one numeric element to compute meaningful statistics. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return a specific value indicating that no statistics can be computed.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding statistical values:
- `mean`: The average of the numbers.
- `median`: The middle value when the numbers are sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring number in the list.
- `variance`: A measure of how much the numbers vary from the mean.
- `standard_deviation`: The square root of the variance, representing the dispersion of the numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input list to ensure it contains numeric values.
- It utilizes the following external library functions to compute the statistics:
  - `np.mean`: Calculates the average of the numbers.
  - `np.median`: Determines the median value of the sorted list.
  - `stats.mode`: Identifies the mode, or the most frequently occurring value.
  - `np.var`: Computes the variance of the numbers.
  - `np.std`: Calculates the standard deviation based on the variance.
- Each of these calculations is performed sequentially, and the results are collected into a dictionary.
- Finally, the function returns this dictionary, providing a comprehensive overview of the descriptive statistics for the input list.
