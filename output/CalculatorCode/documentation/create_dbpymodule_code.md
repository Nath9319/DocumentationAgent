### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a module within the `create_db.py` file, primarily responsible for orchestrating the creation of a sample SQLite database. It leverages the `create_sample_database` function to generate a database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. This module is designed to facilitate the setup of a test environment for applications that require a database with predefined data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not accept any input parameters. It operates independently, generating its own sample data and creating a database without requiring external input.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module initiates the process by calling the `create_sample_database` function, which encapsulates the logic for generating a sample SQLite database.
- Within `create_sample_database`, the following steps are executed:
  - It checks for the existence of a directory to store the CSV file and creates it if necessary.
  - A sample DataFrame containing housing data is generated and saved to a CSV file.
  - The function checks for any existing database file and removes it to ensure a clean slate.
  - A new SQLite database connection is established, and a cursor is created for executing SQL commands.
  - A table is created in the database to store the housing data.
  - The data from the CSV file is loaded into the SQLite table.
  - Finally, the database connection is closed, ensuring all changes are saved and resources are released.
- Throughout this process, the function incorporates error handling to manage potential issues related to database operations, enhancing the robustness of the module.
