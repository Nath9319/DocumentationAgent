### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a utility module designed to facilitate the creation of a sample SQLite database populated with housing data. It orchestrates the process of generating a CSV file containing sample data, establishing a connection to a SQLite database, creating a corresponding table, and populating that table with the data extracted from the CSV file. This module is particularly useful for testing and development purposes, providing a quick way to set up a database environment with predefined data.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not require any external input or parameters. It autonomously generates the necessary sample data and creates a database without user intervention.

**Returns:**
`None`: The module does not return any value. Instead, it performs a series of actions that result in the creation of a database file and a populated table.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **CSV File Generation**: The module initiates the process by generating a CSV file containing structured sample housing data suitable for database storage.

2. **Directory Management**: It checks for the existence of the directory intended for storing the CSV file. If the directory does not exist, it creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.

3. **File Existence Check**: Prior to creating a new CSV file, the module checks if a file with the same name already exists. If it does, the existing file is removed using `os.remove` to prevent conflicts.

4. **DataFrame Creation**: The sample data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame, which provides a convenient structure for data manipulation and export.

5. **CSV Export**: The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method, making the data available for subsequent database insertion.

6. **Database Connection**: A connection to a SQLite database is established using `sqlite3.connect`. If the specified database does not exist, it is created automatically.

7. **Table Creation**: A cursor object is created to execute SQL commands. The module constructs a SQL statement to create a table that mirrors the structure of the DataFrame.

8. **Data Insertion**: The module utilizes the `to_sql` method of the DataFrame to insert the data into the newly created table within the SQLite database.

9. **Error Handling**: Throughout the execution, the module is equipped to handle any SQLite errors that may occur, ensuring robustness and reliability.

10. **Connection Closure**: Finally, the database connection is closed using `conn.close`, ensuring that all resources are properly released and that the database is left in a consistent state.

This module encapsulates the entire workflow of creating a sample database, making it a valuable tool for developers and testers who require a quick setup of a database environment with sample data.
