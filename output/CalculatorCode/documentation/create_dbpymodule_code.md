# Documentation for `create_db.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a utility module within the `create_db.py` file, primarily responsible for orchestrating the creation of a sample SQLite database. This module leverages the `create_sample_database` function to generate a database populated with housing data, facilitating testing and development scenarios.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None: The module does not require any input parameters. It operates independently to create a sample database.

**Returns:**
None: The module does not return any value. Its purpose is to execute the `create_sample_database` function, which performs operations that result in the creation of a database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module begins by importing necessary libraries, including `os.path.join`, which is used to construct file paths in a platform-independent manner.
- It then calls the `create_sample_database` function, which encapsulates the entire workflow for generating a sample SQLite database. This function handles the creation of a CSV file with sample data, establishes a database connection, creates a table, and populates it with the generated data.
- The module ensures that all operations are executed in a controlled manner, allowing for the seamless creation of a database that can be utilized for testing purposes. 

This module is designed to be straightforward and efficient, providing a clear pathway for developers to generate a sample database without the need for complex configurations or inputs.
