### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component of the API routing mechanism within the application. It is responsible for defining and organizing the API endpoints, facilitating the inclusion of various routers that handle specific functionalities of the application. This modular approach enhances the maintainability and scalability of the API by allowing different parts of the application to be developed and tested independently.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` utilizes the `APIRouter` from an external library to create a new router instance. This router is designed to manage the routing of HTTP requests to their corresponding handlers.
- It likely incorporates the `include_router` function from another external library, which allows for the integration of additional routers into the main API router. This enables the application to modularize its endpoints, grouping related functionalities together.
- The overall logic involves setting up the routing structure for the API, ensuring that incoming requests are directed to the appropriate handlers based on the defined routes. This setup is crucial for maintaining a clean and organized codebase, especially as the application grows in complexity.
