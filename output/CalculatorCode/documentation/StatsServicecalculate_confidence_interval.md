### calculate_confidence_interval(data: list, confidence_level: float) -> tuple

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical values. This method provides a statistical range that is likely to contain the true population mean based on the sample data and a specified confidence level.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (e.g., integers or floats) for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): A value between 0 and 1 that represents the desired confidence level for the interval (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of numerical values. The list must contain at least two elements to compute a meaningful confidence interval.
- `confidence_level` must be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will result in an error.

**Returns:**
`tuple`: A tuple containing two elements:
- The lower bound of the confidence interval (`float`).
- The upper bound of the confidence interval (`float`).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first calculates the mean of the provided data using the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library.
- It then computes the standard error of the mean using the `st.sem` function from the SciPy library, which takes into account the sample size.
- The critical value for the confidence interval is determined using the `st.t.ppf` function, which provides the t-distribution value based on the specified confidence level and the degrees of freedom (sample size minus one).
- Finally, the method calculates the margin of error by multiplying the standard error by the critical value, and then constructs the confidence interval by subtracting and adding this margin to the mean.
- The resulting lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval are returned as a tuple.
