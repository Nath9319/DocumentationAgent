### calculate_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence_level: float) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical data. The confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true population mean with a specified level of confidence.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): A value between 0 and 1 that represents the desired confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats or integers. The list must contain at least two elements to compute a meaningful confidence interval.
- `confidence_level` should be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will result in an error.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two floats that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by calculating the mean of the provided data using `np.mean`, which computes the average of the list.
- It then calculates the standard error of the mean using `st.sem`, which provides an estimate of the variability of the sample mean.
- The critical value for the confidence interval is obtained using `st.t.ppf`, which returns the t-statistic corresponding to the specified confidence level and the degrees of freedom (calculated as the length of the data minus one).
- Finally, the function computes the margin of error by multiplying the standard error by the critical value, and it constructs the confidence interval by subtracting and adding this margin to the mean.
- The result is returned as a tuple containing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.
