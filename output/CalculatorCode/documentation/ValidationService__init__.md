# Documentation for `ValidationService.__init__`

### ValidationService.__init__()

**Description:**
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `ValidationService` class, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This setup allows the `ValidationService` to utilize the data loading functionalities provided by the `DataService`, which is essential for performing validation tasks on data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which provides methods for loading data from various sources, such as files and databases.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data_service` parameter must be an instance of the `DataService` class. This instance should be properly configured to connect to the relevant data sources (e.g., databases or files) that the `ValidationService` will validate.

**Returns:**
None: This method does not return any value. It merely sets up the instance of `ValidationService` for use.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method takes an instance of `DataService` as an argument and assigns it to an instance variable within `ValidationService`.
- This establishes a link between the two services, allowing `ValidationService` to call upon the data loading methods of `DataService` for retrieving data that needs to be validated.
- The initialization process ensures that the `ValidationService` is ready to perform its intended operations, leveraging the capabilities of the `DataService` for data handling.
