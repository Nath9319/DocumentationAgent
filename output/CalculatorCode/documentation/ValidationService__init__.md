# Documentation for `ValidationService.__init__`

### ValidationService.__init__(data_service: DataService)

**Description:**
Initializes an instance of the `ValidationService`, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This service is responsible for performing data validation tasks, leveraging the capabilities of `DataService` to load and manipulate data from various sources.

**Parameters:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which provides methods for loading data into pandas objects from files and databases.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data_service` parameter should be an initialized instance of the `DataService` class. This instance must be capable of interacting with data sources, such as SQLite databases or CSV files, to ensure that the `ValidationService` can perform its validation tasks effectively.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return any value. It initializes the `ValidationService` instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of the `ValidationService` class takes a `DataService` instance as an argument.
- This method assigns the provided `data_service` to an instance attribute, allowing the `ValidationService` to utilize the data loading functionalities offered by `DataService`.
- The initialization process ensures that the `ValidationService` is ready to perform its intended operations, which may include validating data loaded from various sources, by leveraging the methods defined in the `DataService` class.
