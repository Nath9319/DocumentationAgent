# Documentation for `ValidationService.__init__`

### ValidationService.__init__()

**Description:**
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `ValidationService` class, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This setup allows the `ValidationService` to leverage the data loading capabilities provided by the `DataService` for its validation operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is responsible for loading data from various sources such as files and databases. This parameter is essential for the `ValidationService` to perform its validation tasks.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data_service` parameter must be an instance of the `DataService` class. It should be properly initialized and capable of connecting to data sources (e.g., SQLite databases or CSV files) to retrieve data for validation purposes.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return any value. It initializes the instance of the `ValidationService`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method assigns the provided `data_service` instance to an internal attribute of the `ValidationService`. This allows the `ValidationService` to access the methods of `DataService` for data retrieval.
- By establishing this dependency, the `ValidationService` can utilize the data loading functionalities of `DataService`, such as fetching data from SQLite databases or reading from CSV files, which are crucial for its validation processes.
- This initialization ensures that the `ValidationService` is ready to perform its intended operations as soon as an instance is created, with the necessary data service readily available for use.
