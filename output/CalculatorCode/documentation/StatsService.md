### StatsService

**Description:**
The `StatsService` class is designed to provide statistical analysis and data processing functionalities. It interacts with a SQLite database to retrieve data, performs various statistical computations, and returns the results. The class leverages external libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for advanced mathematical operations and statistical tests.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `connection` (`sqlite3.Connection`): A connection object used to interact with the SQLite database.
- `data` (`pd.DataFrame`): A DataFrame that holds the data retrieved from the database for analysis.
- `results` (`dict`): A dictionary to store the results of various statistical computations.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- The data retrieved from the database is expected to be in a format compatible with Pandas DataFrames, allowing for statistical operations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value directly but provides methods that return statistical results based on the data processed.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `StatsService` class establishes a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path`.
- It retrieves data from the database and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
- The class includes methods for various statistical operations, such as calculating means, variances, standard deviations, and performing t-tests.
- It utilizes NumPy functions for numerical operations and SciPy functions for statistical tests, ensuring efficient computation.
- The results of the computations are stored in the `results` attribute, which can be accessed through specific methods designed to return the desired statistical metrics.
- The class also handles potential exceptions that may arise during database connections or data retrieval, ensuring robust operation.
