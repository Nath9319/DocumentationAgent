### StatsService

**Description:**
The `StatsService` class is designed to provide statistical analysis and data processing functionalities. It serves as a service layer that interacts with a SQLite database to retrieve data, perform various statistical computations, and return the results in a structured format. The class utilizes several external libraries for data manipulation and statistical analysis, ensuring robust and efficient processing of data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the service retrieves data.
- `connection` (`sqlite3.Connection`): An active connection to the SQLite database, established upon initialization of the class.
- `data` (`pd.DataFrame`): A DataFrame that holds the data retrieved from the database for further analysis.
- `results` (`dict`): A dictionary that stores the results of various statistical computations performed by the class methods.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- The data retrieved from the database is expected to be in a format compatible with pandas DataFrames, allowing for efficient manipulation and analysis.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return any values directly upon instantiation. However, it provides methods that return various statistical results based on the data processed.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `StatsService` class establishes a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path`. It retrieves data from the database and loads it into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- The class includes methods that perform various statistical analyses, such as calculating means, medians, standard deviations, and performing t-tests. These methods leverage external libraries like NumPy and SciPy for efficient computation.
- The class also provides functionality to compute correlations and regressions, utilizing methods from NumPy and pandas.
- Results from the computations are stored in the `results` attribute, allowing for easy access and retrieval after analysis.
- The class is designed to handle various statistical tasks, making it a versatile tool for data analysis within the application.
