### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central configuration module within the application, leveraging the `Settings` class to manage and access application settings derived from environment variables. This module is responsible for ensuring that the application can retrieve necessary configuration values consistently and reliably.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not define any parameters or attributes directly. It primarily utilizes the `Settings` class to handle configuration settings.

**Expected Input:**
- The `module_code` expects that relevant environment variables are defined prior to its usage. These variables should contain necessary configuration values such as database connection strings, API keys, and other settings essential for the application's functionality.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not return any value. Its purpose is to facilitate the retrieval and management of configuration settings rather than to produce a direct output.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` interacts with the `Settings` class, which is designed to load and validate configuration settings from environment variables. 
- Upon its execution, it initializes the `Settings` class, which in turn reads the environment variables and populates its attributes accordingly.
- The logic ensures that any required settings are present and correctly formatted, potentially raising exceptions or providing default values for missing or invalid configurations.
- By centralizing configuration management, the `module_code` promotes better organization and maintainability within the codebase, allowing for easier updates and modifications to application settings as needed.
