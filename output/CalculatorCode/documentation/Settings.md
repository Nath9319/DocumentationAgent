### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is responsible for managing application settings that are loaded from environment variables. It provides a structured way to access configuration values needed throughout the application, ensuring that these values are consistently retrieved and validated.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon instantiation. Instead, it relies on environment variables to populate its attributes.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to its instantiation. These variables should correspond to the configuration attributes defined within the class. The absence of required environment variables may lead to errors or default values being used.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes its attributes based on the environment variables.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `Settings` class utilizes the `BaseSettings` class from an external library to load and validate configuration values from the environment.
- The class likely defines various attributes that correspond to specific settings required by the application, such as database connection strings, API keys, or feature flags.
- The `Config` class from another external library may be used to provide additional configuration management capabilities, such as validation, type conversion, or default values.
- The logic within the `Settings` class ensures that all necessary settings are retrieved and can be accessed in a consistent manner throughout the application, promoting better maintainability and reducing the risk of misconfiguration.
