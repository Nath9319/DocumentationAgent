### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is designed to manage application configuration settings, which are primarily loaded from environment variables. This class serves as a centralized location for accessing various configuration parameters required by the application, ensuring that they are easily retrievable and maintainable.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon instantiation. Instead, it relies on environment variables to populate its attributes.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to its instantiation. These variables should adhere to the naming conventions and types expected by the application. If an expected environment variable is not set, the class may raise an error or use default values, depending on its implementation.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides access to its attributes, which represent the configuration settings.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon creation of an instance of the `Settings` class, it utilizes the `BaseSettings` class from an external library to facilitate the loading of environment variables. This base class likely includes mechanisms for parsing and validating the environment variables.
- The `Settings` class may define specific attributes that correspond to various configuration settings, such as database connection strings, API keys, or feature flags. These attributes are populated based on the values retrieved from the environment variables.
- The class may also include methods for validating the loaded settings or providing defaults if certain environment variables are not set.
- The interaction with the `Config` external library suggests that there may be additional configuration management features, such as merging settings from multiple sources or providing a structured way to access configuration data.

This class is essential for ensuring that the application can be configured dynamically based on the environment in which it is running, promoting flexibility and ease of deployment.
