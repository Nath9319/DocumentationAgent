# Documentation for `Settings`

### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is designed to manage application configuration settings that are loaded from environment variables. It provides a structured way to access and utilize these settings throughout the application, ensuring that configuration values are consistently retrieved and validated.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon initialization. Instead, it relies on environment variables to populate its attributes.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be defined prior to its instantiation. These variables should contain configuration values relevant to the application, such as database connection strings, API keys, and other settings necessary for the application's operation.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return any value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes its attributes based on the environment variables.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon creation, the `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings`, which is likely part of an external library designed to facilitate the loading and validation of configuration settings from various sources, including environment variables.
- The class may utilize the `Config` dependency to define the structure and validation rules for the settings it manages. This ensures that any required settings are present and correctly formatted.
- The logic within the class may include mechanisms to handle missing or invalid environment variables, potentially raising exceptions or providing default values as necessary.
- Overall, the `Settings` class serves as a centralized point for accessing application configuration, promoting better organization and maintainability of the codebase.
