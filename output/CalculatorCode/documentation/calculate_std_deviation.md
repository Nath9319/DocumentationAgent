### calculate_std_deviation(data: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, providing insight into the spread of the data points around the mean.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a list containing numerical values. The list must not be empty, as the standard deviation cannot be computed for an empty dataset. The values should be of types that can be processed by the NumPy library, typically integers or floats.

**Returns:**
`float`: The calculated standard deviation of the provided list of numbers, represented as a floating-point number.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `np.std()` method from the NumPy library to compute the standard deviation. This method calculates the standard deviation by first determining the mean of the data points, then measuring the average distance of each data point from the mean.
- The result is converted to a float before being returned, ensuring that the output is in a consistent numerical format.
- This function is dependent on the NumPy library for its statistical calculations, which provides efficient and optimized methods for handling numerical data.
