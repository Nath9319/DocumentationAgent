# Documentation for `calculate_std_deviation`

### calculate_std_deviation(data: List[float]) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a given list of numerical data points. Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. This function is designed to provide insights into the spread of the data, which can be useful in statistical analysis and decision-making processes.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers representing the dataset for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of numerical values (floats). The function expects at least one data point to compute the standard deviation. If the list is empty, it may raise an exception.

**Returns:**
`float`: The calculated standard deviation of the input data, representing the dispersion of the data points from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input to ensure that the `data` list is not empty.
- It then computes the mean (average) of the data points.
- Following this, it calculates the variance by determining the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- Finally, the standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- The function may utilize the `stats_svc.calculate_standard_deviation` service to perform the actual calculation, ensuring that the logic is encapsulated and reusable.
- If any errors occur during the calculation process, such as invalid input types or empty datasets, the function may raise an `APIException` to handle these scenarios gracefully.
