### calculate_std_deviation(data: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. This function is essential for statistical analysis, providing a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a list containing numerical values. It is important that the list is not empty, as calculating the standard deviation of an empty list is undefined and may lead to an error.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input list, represented as a floating-point number. This value indicates how much the individual numbers in the list deviate from the mean of the list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `calculate_standard_deviation` method from the `StatsService` class, which computes the standard deviation using the NumPy library's `np.std()` function.
- The standard deviation is calculated by first determining the mean of the data, then computing the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
- The result is returned as a floating-point number, which provides a clear representation of the variability within the dataset.
- This function is designed to be used within an API context, where it may be called upon to process statistical requests, and it may raise an `APIException` if the input data is invalid or if an error occurs during processing.
