# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_series_from_sqlite(db_path: str, table_name: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_sqlite` method retrieves a specific column from a designated SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is useful for extracting and manipulating data from a SQLite database in a format that is compatible with pandas, facilitating data analysis and processing.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the SQLite database that contains the desired data.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to be extracted from the specified table.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `table_name` should be a valid string that corresponds to a table within the database.
- `column_name` should be a valid string that matches a column name in the specified table.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the values from the specified column of the table. If the column does not exist or if the table is empty, an appropriate error will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by validating the existence of the SQLite database file at the provided `db_path`. If the file does not exist, it raises a `DataError` indicating the issue.
- It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and constructs a SQL query to select the specified column from the given table.
- The query is executed, and the results are fetched into a pandas DataFrame.
- If the resulting DataFrame is empty or the specified column does not exist, a `DataError` is raised to inform the user of the problem.
- Finally, if the column is successfully retrieved, it is returned as a pandas Series for further use in data analysis or processing.
