# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_series_from_sqlite(column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_sqlite` method retrieves data from a specified column of a SQLite database table and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is part of the `DataService` class, which is responsible for data operations related to SQLite databases.

**Parameters:**
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column from which to read data in the SQLite table. This parameter is essential for identifying the specific data to be extracted.

**Expected Input:**
- `column_name` should be a valid string representing the name of an existing column in the SQLite table. If the column does not exist or if the input is invalid, the method may raise a `DataError`.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the values from the specified column in the SQLite table. The Series will have an index corresponding to the row identifiers in the original table.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling `self.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, which retrieves the entire table as a pandas DataFrame. This function is expected to handle the connection to the SQLite database and the execution of the SQL query necessary to fetch the data.
- Once the DataFrame is obtained, the method accesses the specified column using the provided `column_name`.
- If the column exists, its values are returned as a pandas Series. If the column does not exist or if any other data-related issue arises, a `DataError` may be raised to signal the problem, allowing for appropriate error handling in the calling code.
- This method effectively abstracts the complexity of database interactions, providing a straightforward interface for users to access specific data columns directly as pandas Series.
