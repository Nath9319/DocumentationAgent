# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_series_from_sqlite(db_path: str, table_name: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_sqlite` method retrieves a specific column from a designated SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series. This functionality is essential for extracting and manipulating data stored in SQLite databases, allowing for efficient data analysis and processing.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the SQLite database that contains the desired column.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to be extracted from the specified table.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `table_name` should be a valid string that corresponds to an existing table within the database.
- `column_name` should be a valid string that matches the name of a column in the specified table.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the values from the specified column of the table. If the column does not exist or if the table is empty, a `DataError` will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path`.
- It then constructs a SQL query to select the specified column from the designated table.
- The query is executed, and the results are loaded into a pandas Series.
- If the specified column does not exist or if the table is empty, the method raises a `DataError`, providing a clear indication of the issue encountered.
- The method ensures that the database connection is properly closed after the operation, maintaining resource integrity and preventing potential database locks. 

This method is particularly useful for applications that require quick access to specific data points within a larger dataset, facilitating data-driven decision-making and analysis.
