### MatrixInput.to_numpy_array() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**
Converts the internal representation of a matrix stored within the `MatrixInput` class into a NumPy array format. This method facilitates numerical computations by transforming the matrix data into a structure that is compatible with NumPy's array operations.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on an instance of the `MatrixInput` class, which is expected to contain matrix data in a format that can be converted to a NumPy array. The specific format of the internal matrix representation is not detailed, but it should be compatible with NumPy's array conversion capabilities.

**Returns:**
`np.ndarray`: A NumPy array representation of the matrix contained within the `MatrixInput` instance. This array can be used for further numerical analysis or operations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `np.array` function from the NumPy library to perform the conversion. 
- It accesses the internal matrix data stored in the `MatrixInput` instance and passes it to `np.array`, which handles the transformation into a NumPy array.
- The resulting array inherits the properties of a NumPy array, allowing for efficient mathematical operations and manipulations that are optimized for performance in scientific computing.
