# Documentation for `MatrixInput.to_numpy_array`

### MatrixInput.to_numpy_array() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**
The `to_numpy_array` method converts the internal representation of a `MatrixInput` object into a NumPy array. This transformation allows for efficient numerical computations and manipulations using the powerful features of the NumPy library.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on an instance of the `MatrixInput` class, which is expected to contain data structured in a way that can be converted into a NumPy array. The specific structure of this data is determined by the implementation of the `MatrixInput` class.

**Returns:**
`np.ndarray`: A NumPy array representation of the data contained within the `MatrixInput` instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `np.array` function from the NumPy library to perform the conversion.
- It retrieves the internal data from the `MatrixInput` instance, which is then passed to `np.array` to create a new NumPy array.
- This process ensures that the resulting array is compatible with NumPy's array operations, enabling further mathematical and statistical analysis.
- The method does not handle any exceptions or errors related to the conversion process, so it is assumed that the internal data is always in a valid format for conversion.
