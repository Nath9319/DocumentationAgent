# Documentation for `get_correlation_matrix`

### get_correlation_matrix() -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
The `get_correlation_matrix` function computes and returns the correlation matrix for a given dataset. This matrix provides insights into the relationships between different variables, indicating how closely related they are. The function validates the input data before performing the correlation calculation, ensuring that the data is suitable for analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`Any`): The dataset for which the correlation matrix is to be calculated. This can be a DataFrame or any structure that can be validated and processed to extract numerical relationships.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a structured dataset, typically in the form of a DataFrame. It must contain numerical values for the correlation calculation to be meaningful. The function expects the data to be pre-validated to ensure it meets the necessary criteria for correlation analysis.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A DataFrame representing the correlation matrix, where each cell indicates the correlation coefficient between pairs of variables in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data using the `validator.validate_correlation_inputs` method. This step ensures that the data is appropriate for correlation analysis, checking for issues such as missing values or non-numeric types.
- Upon successful validation, the function calls `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix`, which performs the actual computation of the correlation matrix using statistical methods.
- The resulting correlation matrix is then returned as a DataFrame, allowing for easy interpretation and further analysis of the relationships between the variables in the dataset.
