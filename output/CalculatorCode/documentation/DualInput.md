# Documentation for `DualInput`

### DualInput

**Description:**
The `DualInput` class serves as a model for operations that require two numerical inputs. It is designed to facilitate calculations or operations that depend on two distinct values, providing a structured way to manage and manipulate these inputs.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle two numerical values, typically provided through its methods or during instantiation. These values can be integers or floats, and they should be valid numbers to ensure proper operation.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DualInput` class likely extends from a base model, `BaseModel`, which may provide foundational functionality or attributes common to all models in the application.
- While the specific methods and operations of `DualInput` are not detailed in the provided information, it can be inferred that the class will include methods to set, retrieve, and possibly perform calculations using the two input values.
- The class may implement validation checks to ensure that the inputs are indeed numerical and handle any exceptions that arise from invalid inputs.
- The design of this class suggests a focus on encapsulating the behavior and properties of two-number operations, making it easier to manage and extend functionality in the future.
