### DualInput

**Description:**
The `DualInput` class serves as a model for operations that require two numerical inputs. It is designed to facilitate calculations or operations that depend on two distinct values, providing a structured way to manage and manipulate these inputs within the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.)

**Expected Input:**
- The `DualInput` class is expected to handle two numerical values, although the specific methods for inputting these values are not detailed in the provided context. Users should ensure that the inputs are of a numeric type (e.g., integers or floats) to avoid type-related errors during operations.

**Returns:**
- None (The class itself does not return a value but is intended to support operations that will utilize the two numerical inputs.)

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DualInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may leverage functionalities provided by this external library. The specifics of how `DualInput` interacts with `BaseModel` are not detailed, but it likely includes methods for validation, serialization, or other model-related tasks.
- The class is structured to encapsulate two numerical inputs, allowing for operations that may include addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, depending on the implementation of additional methods that may be defined in the class.
- The design implies that the class will provide a framework for managing the two inputs, ensuring that they are processed correctly for any calculations or operations that follow.
