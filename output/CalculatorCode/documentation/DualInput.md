### DualInput

**Description:**
The `DualInput` class serves as a model for operations that require two numerical inputs. It is designed to facilitate calculations or manipulations that involve pairs of numbers, leveraging the structure and functionality provided by its parent class, `BaseModel`.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `DualInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle two numerical inputs, which can be integers or floats. The specific nature of these inputs (e.g., whether they can be negative or zero) may depend on the operations defined in the methods of the class, which are not detailed in the provided information.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return any value upon instantiation. However, it is likely that methods within the class will return results based on the two input numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DualInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which implies that it may utilize or override methods and properties defined in the base class. The main logic of the `DualInput` class revolves around managing and processing two numerical inputs for various operations.
- While the specific operations are not detailed in the provided information, it can be inferred that the class will implement methods that perform calculations or transformations using the two inputs, potentially calling upon methods from `BaseModel` to handle common functionalities or validations.
- The design of the class suggests that it is part of a larger system that may involve multiple models or components, where dual numerical inputs are a common requirement for various calculations.
