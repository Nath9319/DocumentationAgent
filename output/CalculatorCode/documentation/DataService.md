### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class is designed to facilitate the loading of data into pandas DataFrames from various sources, including files and databases. It provides methods to read data efficiently, ensuring that the data is accessible for further analysis and processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
The class does not have specific input parameters as it is a service class. However, its methods expect specific types of input:
- For database-related methods, a valid database path (string) and a table name (string) are required.
- For file-related methods, a valid file path (string) and the appropriate file format (e.g., CSV) must be provided.

**Returns:**
The methods of the `DataService` class typically return a `pandas.DataFrame` object, which represents the loaded data. If the data source is invalid or the data cannot be loaded, appropriate exceptions are raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataService` class utilizes several external libraries, including `os`, `sqlite3`, and `pandas`, to perform its operations.
- It checks the existence of files or databases using `os.path.exists` to ensure that the specified paths are valid before attempting to load data.
- For database interactions, it establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`, executes SQL queries to retrieve data, and loads the results into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_sql_query`.
- The class includes error handling to manage scenarios where the database file does not exist, the specified table is empty, or other database-related errors occur, raising a custom `DataError` exception with informative messages.
- The methods are designed to be reusable, allowing other services (like `ValidationService` and `StatsService`) to leverage the data loading capabilities provided by the `DataService` class.
