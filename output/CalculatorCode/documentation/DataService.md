# Documentation for `DataService`

### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class is designed to facilitate the loading of data into pandas DataFrame objects from various sources, including files and databases. It provides methods to handle different data formats, ensuring that users can easily access and manipulate their data within a pandas environment.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `db_connection` (`sqlite3.Connection`): A connection object to a SQLite database, used for executing SQL queries.
- `file_path` (`str`): The path to the file from which data will be loaded, applicable for CSV files.
- `data_source` (`str`): A string indicating the source of the data, which could be a file path or a database identifier.

**Expected Input:**
- The `db_connection` should be a valid SQLite connection object, established using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- The `file_path` must be a string representing the path to a CSV file, which should exist on the filesystem.
- The `data_source` should be a string that specifies whether the data is coming from a file or a database.

**Returns:**
`DataFrame`: The class methods return a pandas DataFrame containing the loaded data, allowing for further data manipulation and analysis.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The class initializes with parameters for database connection, file path, and data source.
- It includes methods to check the existence of files using `os.path.exists`, ensuring that the specified file is available before attempting to load it.
- For loading data from a SQLite database, the class utilizes `pd.read_sql_query` to execute SQL commands and retrieve data as a DataFrame.
- When loading data from a CSV file, it employs `pd.read_csv` to read the contents of the file into a DataFrame.
- The class also incorporates functionality to handle in-memory data using `StringIO`, allowing for flexible data loading scenarios.
- The methods are designed to provide clear error handling and informative messages if the data loading process encounters issues, ensuring a robust user experience.
