### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class is responsible for loading data into pandas DataFrames from various sources, including files and databases. It provides a structured approach to data retrieval, ensuring that data is correctly loaded and any errors encountered during the process are handled appropriately.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not define any specific attributes in the provided code segment.)

**Expected Input:**
- The class methods expect valid file paths or database connection strings as input. For database operations, the specified tables must exist within the database, and the database file must be accessible.

**Returns:**
- The methods within this class typically return pandas DataFrames containing the loaded data. If an error occurs during the data loading process, a `DataError` exception is raised instead.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataService` class utilizes various external libraries, including `os`, `sqlite3`, and `pandas`, to facilitate data loading operations.
- One of the key methods, `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, connects to a SQLite database using a specified database path and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame. 
- It first checks if the database file exists using `os.path.exists`. If the file is not found, it raises a `DataError` indicating the issue.
- Upon establishing a connection to the database, it executes a SQL query to select all records from the specified table. If the table is empty or does not exist, it raises a `DataError`.
- The method ensures that the database connection is closed after the operation, maintaining resource management.
- If any exceptions occur during the database operations, they are caught and re-raised as `DataError` exceptions with a descriptive message, allowing for clearer debugging and error handling in the application.
