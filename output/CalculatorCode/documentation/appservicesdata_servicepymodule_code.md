# Documentation for `app\services\data_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component within the `data_service.py` file, which is part of the applicationâ€™s service layer. This module is responsible for orchestrating the data loading operations facilitated by the `DataService` class. It acts as a bridge between the data loading functionalities and other components of the application, ensuring that data is efficiently retrieved and made available for analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
The `module_code` does not directly accept input parameters, as it primarily coordinates the operations of the `DataService` class. However, it is expected to interact with various data sources, which may include:
- Valid database paths (string) and table names (string) for database operations.
- Valid file paths (string) and file formats (e.g., CSV) for file-related data loading.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` utilizes the `DataService` class to load data from various sources, including files and databases.
- It ensures that the necessary data loading methods are invoked correctly, passing the appropriate parameters as required by the `DataService`.
- The module may include error handling to manage exceptions raised by the `DataService`, such as `DataError`, ensuring that any issues during data loading are appropriately logged or communicated to the user.
- By leveraging the reusable methods of the `DataService`, the `module_code` enhances the overall data handling capabilities of the application, allowing other services to access and utilize the loaded data seamlessly.
