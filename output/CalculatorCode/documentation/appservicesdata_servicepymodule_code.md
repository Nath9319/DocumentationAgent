# Documentation for `app\services\data_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central point for the `DataService` class, which is designed to facilitate the loading of data into pandas DataFrames from various sources, such as files and databases. This module encapsulates the logic necessary for data retrieval, ensuring that data is accurately loaded while managing any errors that may arise during the process.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The methods within the `DataService` class expect valid file paths or database connection strings as input. For database operations, the specified tables must exist within the database, and the database file must be accessible.

**Returns:**
- The methods typically return pandas DataFrames containing the loaded data. If an error occurs during the data loading process, a `DataError` exception is raised instead.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` interacts with the `DataService` class, which utilizes external libraries such as `os`, `sqlite3`, and `pandas` to perform data loading operations.
- A key method within the `DataService` class, `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, connects to a SQLite database using a specified database path and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame.
- The method first checks for the existence of the database file using `os.path.exists`. If the file is not found, it raises a `DataError`.
- Upon establishing a connection to the database, it executes a SQL query to select all records from the specified table. If the table is empty or does not exist, it raises a `DataError`.
- The method ensures proper resource management by closing the database connection after the operation.
- Any exceptions encountered during database operations are caught and re-raised as `DataError` exceptions with descriptive messages, enhancing debugging and error handling capabilities within the application.
