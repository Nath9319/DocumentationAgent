### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite() -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
This method connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame. It facilitates data access for other services, specifically `ValidationService` and `StatsService`, by providing a structured representation of the data stored in the database.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects the SQLite database to be accessible and the specified table to exist within that database. There are no specific input parameters required for this method.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A pandas DataFrame containing all the records from the specified table in the SQLite database. This DataFrame can be used for further data manipulation and analysis.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`, ensuring that the database file exists and is accessible.
- It then executes a SQL query to select all records from a specified table using `pd.read_sql_query`, which reads the results directly into a pandas DataFrame.
- After retrieving the data, the method ensures that the database connection is properly closed using `conn.close`, which is crucial for resource management and preventing database locks.
- If any errors occur during the data retrieval process, the method is designed to raise a `DataError`, allowing for specific error handling related to data integrity or connection issues. This enhances the robustness of the data retrieval process.
