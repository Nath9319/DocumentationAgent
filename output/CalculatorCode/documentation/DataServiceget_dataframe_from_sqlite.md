# Documentation for `DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite() -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
This method connects to a specified SQLite database and retrieves an entire table, returning it as a pandas DataFrame. It serves as a utility function for other services, specifically `ValidationService` and `StatsService`, to facilitate data access and manipulation.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the SQLite database that is to be fetched.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. The method checks for the existence of this file before attempting to connect.
- `table_name` should be a valid string representing the name of the table to be queried. The table must exist within the specified database.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A pandas DataFrame containing all rows and columns from the specified table in the SQLite database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by verifying the existence of the SQLite database file at the provided `db_path` using `os.path.exists`. If the file does not exist, it raises a `DataError` to indicate the issue.
- Upon confirming the file's existence, the method establishes a connection to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`.
- It then constructs a SQL query to select all data from the specified `table_name`.
- The SQL query is executed using `pd.read_sql_query`, which retrieves the data and automatically converts it into a pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the method ensures that the database connection is properly closed using `conn.close`, regardless of whether the data retrieval was successful or not, to prevent any potential resource leaks.
