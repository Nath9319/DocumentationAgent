### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite() -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
This method connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame. It is designed to facilitate data extraction for further processing or analysis, making it accessible for other services such as `ValidationService` and `StatsService`.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the SQLite database that is to be converted into a DataFrame.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. If the path does not exist, an error will be raised.
- `table_name` should be a valid string that corresponds to an existing table within the specified SQLite database. If the table does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A pandas DataFrame containing all rows and columns from the specified table in the SQLite database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by checking if the provided database path exists using `os.path.exists`. If the path is invalid, it raises a `DataError` to indicate the issue.
- Upon confirming the existence of the database, it establishes a connection to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`.
- A SQL query is constructed to select all data from the specified table using `pd.read_sql_query`, which executes the query and retrieves the data as a DataFrame.
- After the data is successfully fetched, the database connection is closed using `conn.close` to ensure that resources are released.
- If any errors occur during the data retrieval process, a `DataError` is raised, providing a clear indication of the nature of the issue encountered.
