### calculate_z_scores(numbers: list) -> list

**Description:**
Calculates the Z-scores for a given list of numerical values. Z-scores indicate how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset, providing a way to understand the relative position of each value within the distribution.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the Z-scores are to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a non-empty list containing numerical values. The list can include both integers and floats. It is important that the list contains at least two elements to compute a meaningful standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`list`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to each value in the input list. Each Z-score is a float representing the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean of the input list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations.
- It then calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean`, which provides the average value of the dataset.
- Next, it computes the standard deviation using `np.std`, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the dataset.
- Finally, the Z-scores are calculated by subtracting the mean from each number and dividing the result by the standard deviation. This operation is vectorized through NumPy, allowing for efficient computation across the entire array.
- The method returns a new list containing the calculated Z-scores, enabling users to easily interpret the relative standing of each number in the context of the dataset.
