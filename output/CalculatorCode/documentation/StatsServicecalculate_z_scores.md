### calculate_z_scores(numbers: list) -> list

**Description:**
Calculates the Z-scores for a given list of numerical values. A Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset. This method is useful for standardizing data, allowing for comparison across different datasets or distributions.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the Z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a non-empty list containing numerical values. It is important that the list has at least two elements to compute a meaningful Z-score, as both mean and standard deviation are required for the calculation.

**Returns:**
`list`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input values. Each Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean of the input list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations.
- It then calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean`, which provides the average value of the dataset.
- Next, it computes the standard deviation using `np.std`, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the dataset.
- For each number in the original list, the Z-score is calculated using the formula: 
  \[
  Z = \frac{(X - \text{mean})}{\text{std\_dev}}
  \]
  where \(X\) is each individual number, \(\text{mean}\) is the average of the numbers, and \(\text{std\_dev}\) is the standard deviation.
- Finally, the method returns a list of the calculated Z-scores, allowing users to understand the relative position of each number within the context of the dataset.
