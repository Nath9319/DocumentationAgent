### calculate_z_scores(numbers: list) -> list

**Description:**
Calculates the Z-Scores for a given list of numbers. Z-Scores indicate how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset, providing a way to understand the relative position of each number within the distribution.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values for which Z-Scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a list containing numerical values (integers or floats). The list must not be empty, as Z-Scores cannot be computed without a mean and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`list`: A list of Z-Scores corresponding to each number in the input list. Each Z-Score is a float representing the number of standard deviations away from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first converts the input list of numbers into a NumPy array to facilitate mathematical operations.
- It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the array using `np.mean` and `np.std`, respectively.
- Each Z-Score is computed by subtracting the mean from each number and then dividing by the standard deviation.
- The resulting Z-Scores are rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places for clarity before being returned as a list. 

This method leverages NumPy's efficient array operations to perform the calculations, ensuring that the function is both concise and performant.
