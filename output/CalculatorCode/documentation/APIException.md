# Documentation for `APIException`

### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within the API framework of the application. It serves as a foundation for creating more specific exception types that can be raised during API operations. This class facilitates the implementation of a structured exception handling mechanism, allowing the application to return well-defined JSON error messages to clients, thereby improving error reporting and debugging.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None. The `APIException` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from the base `Exception` class.

**Expected Input:**
- The `APIException` class can be instantiated with any arguments that are valid for the built-in `Exception` class. This typically includes a message string that describes the error.

**Returns:**
None. The `APIException` class does not return a value; it raises an exception when instantiated.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIException` class inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class, which provides the basic functionality for exception handling.
- When an instance of `APIException` is created, it calls the constructor of the base `Exception` class using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the `Exception` class is executed, allowing for standard exception behavior.
- The primary purpose of this class is to enable the creation of custom exceptions that can be caught and handled in a structured manner within the API's main application logic, particularly in the `main.py` file where the custom exception handler is implemented. This enhances the ability to return structured JSON responses for error scenarios, improving the overall user experience and API usability.
