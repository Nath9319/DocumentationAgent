### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within an API context. It facilitates the creation of a structured error response mechanism, allowing for consistent JSON-formatted error messages to be returned to clients when exceptions occur. This class serves as a foundation for defining more specific exceptions that can be raised throughout the API.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the error (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).
- `detail` (`str`): A string providing a detailed message about the error, which can be useful for debugging or informing the client about the nature of the issue.

**Expected Input:**
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically a non-negative integer.
- `detail` should be a descriptive string that conveys the error information clearly.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return a value but initializes an instance of the `APIException` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `APIException` class captures the provided `status_code` and `detail` attributes.
- It calls the constructor of its superclass (`Exception`) with the `detail` message, ensuring that the exception can be raised and caught in a standard manner.
- This class does not implement any additional methods or logic beyond the initialization of its attributes, but it serves as a foundational class for other exceptions that may extend its functionality.
