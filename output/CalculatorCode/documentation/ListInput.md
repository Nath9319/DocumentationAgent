### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model designed to facilitate operations on a list of numerical values. It serves as a structured representation of a collection of numbers, enabling various mathematical and statistical operations to be performed on the list.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers that the model will operate on. This attribute is essential for the functionality of the class, as it defines the dataset on which operations will be performed.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (specifically, floats). The list can be empty, but it is expected that the operations performed on it will handle such cases appropriately. There are no specific constraints on the size of the list, but operations may vary in performance based on the number of elements.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class itself does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods for performing operations on the list of numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ListInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality and structure for data models.
- The class utilizes the `Field` from an external library to define the `numbers` attribute, ensuring that it is properly validated and managed within the model.
- The primary logic of the class revolves around the manipulation and analysis of the list of numbers, although specific methods for these operations are not detailed in the provided information.
- The class is expected to integrate with other components of the application, allowing for seamless data handling and processing in conjunction with the broader functionality of the calculator module.
