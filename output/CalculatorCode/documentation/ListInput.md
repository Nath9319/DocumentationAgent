# Documentation for `ListInput`

### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model class designed for performing operations on a list of numerical values. It serves as a structured way to manage and manipulate collections of numbers, providing a foundation for further calculations or analyses.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `ListInput` class does not define any parameters or attributes in its constructor.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle a list of numbers, which can include integers and floats. The input list should be well-formed and contain only numerical values to ensure proper functionality during operations.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any value upon instantiation. However, it is expected to provide methods for performing operations on the list of numbers, which may return various results based on the implemented functionality.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ListInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational features and behaviors common to all models in the application. This inheritance suggests that `ListInput` may leverage methods or properties defined in `BaseModel` for data validation, serialization, or other model-related tasks.
- The class utilizes the `List` type from Python's typing module, indicating that it is designed to work specifically with lists, ensuring type safety and clarity in the expected data structure.
- Additionally, the class may utilize the `Field` function to define attributes or constraints on the list of numbers, although specific fields are not detailed in the provided information. This could involve validation rules, default values, or metadata associated with the list.
- Overall, `ListInput` serves as a specialized model for encapsulating a list of numbers, potentially enabling further operations such as aggregation, transformation, or statistical analysis, depending on the methods implemented in the class.
