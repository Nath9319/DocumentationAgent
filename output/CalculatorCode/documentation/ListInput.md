### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model class designed to facilitate operations on a list of numerical values. It serves as a structured representation of a collection of numbers, enabling various mathematical and statistical computations to be performed on the data contained within the list.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers that the model operates on. This attribute is essential for the functionality of the class, as it holds the data that will be manipulated or analyzed.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (specifically floats). The list can be empty, but it is expected that any operations performed on it will handle such cases appropriately. There are no specific constraints on the values, but they should be finite numbers.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it provides methods that may return results based on the operations performed on the `numbers` list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ListInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality and structure for data models, including validation and serialization capabilities.
- The class utilizes the `Field` from an external library to define the `numbers` attribute, ensuring that it is treated as a field within the model, which may include validation rules or metadata.
- The primary logic of the class revolves around the manipulation of the `numbers` list, allowing for various operations such as addition, averaging, or other statistical calculations. The specific methods for these operations would be defined elsewhere in the class or inherited from `BaseModel`.
- The class is designed to be extensible, allowing for additional methods or attributes to be added as needed for more complex operations on the list of numbers.
