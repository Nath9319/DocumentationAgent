# Documentation for `get_confidence_interval`

### get_confidence_interval() -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_confidence_interval` function is designed to calculate and return the confidence interval for a given statistical dataset. It serves as an endpoint in the API, allowing clients to request statistical analysis based on input data. The function utilizes a service layer to perform the actual calculation of the confidence interval, ensuring a separation of concerns within the codebase.

**Parameters:**
- `Depends`: This function utilizes dependency injection to retrieve necessary parameters and services. The specific parameters are not explicitly listed, as they are managed by the dependency injection framework.

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects input data to be provided through an API request. This data typically includes statistical values or datasets required for calculating the confidence interval. The exact format and constraints of the input data depend on the implementation of the dependency injection and the underlying service that processes the request.

**Returns:**
`dict`: The function returns a dictionary containing the calculated confidence interval, which includes lower and upper bounds, along with any other relevant statistical information.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon invocation, the `get_confidence_interval` function is triggered by a POST request routed through the API.
- It leverages the `Depends` mechanism to inject necessary dependencies, which may include request data and services required for processing.
- The function calls `stats_svc.calculate_confidence_interval`, a service method responsible for performing the actual computation of the confidence interval based on the provided input data.
- The results from the service method are then formatted into a dictionary structure before being returned to the client, ensuring that the response is structured and easily interpretable.
- Error handling is managed through the use of the `APIException` class, which allows for consistent and informative error responses in case of issues during the calculation process.
