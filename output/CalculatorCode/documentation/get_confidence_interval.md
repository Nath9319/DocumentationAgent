### get_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence: float) -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_confidence_interval` function calculates the confidence interval for a given set of numerical data. It utilizes statistical methods to determine the range within which the true population mean is likely to fall, based on the sample data provided and the specified confidence level.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers representing the sample data for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence` (`float`): A floating-point number between 0 and 1 that represents the desired confidence level for the interval (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The list must contain numerical values to perform statistical calculations.
- `confidence` should be a float value within the range of 0 to 1. Values outside this range may lead to undefined behavior or errors.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated mean, the specified confidence level, and the confidence interval as a list of two floats representing the lower and upper bounds.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks the length of the input data to ensure it is sufficient for statistical analysis.
- It calculates the mean of the data using NumPy's mean function.
- The standard error of the mean (SEM) is computed using the `st.sem` function from the SciPy library.
- The margin of error is determined by multiplying the SEM by the t-distribution value corresponding to the specified confidence level and the sample size.
- Finally, the function constructs and returns a dictionary that includes the mean, the confidence level, and the calculated confidence interval, which is represented as a list containing the lower and upper bounds. 

This function relies on the `calculate_confidence_interval` method from the `StatsService` class to perform the actual statistical calculations, ensuring accurate and efficient processing of the data.
