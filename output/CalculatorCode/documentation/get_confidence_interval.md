### get_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence: float) -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_confidence_interval` function calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical data. It utilizes statistical methods to determine the range within which the true population mean is expected to lie, based on the provided confidence level.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers representing the sample data for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence` (`float`): A floating-point number between 0 and 1 that represents the confidence level for the interval (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence level).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The list must contain numerical values to perform statistical calculations.
- `confidence` should be a float value within the range of 0 to 1. Values outside this range will not yield valid confidence intervals.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys:
- `mean`: The mean of the provided data as a float.
- `confidence_level`: The confidence level used for the calculation as a float.
- `interval`: A list of two floats representing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks the validity of the input parameters, ensuring that the `data` list is not empty and that the `confidence` level is within the acceptable range.
- It calculates the mean of the data using the `numpy` library.
- The standard error of the mean is computed using the `scipy.stats.sem` function, which provides a measure of how much the sample mean is expected to vary from the true population mean.
- The margin of error is then determined by multiplying the standard error by the critical value from the t-distribution, which is obtained using the `scipy.stats.t.ppf` function. This critical value depends on the specified confidence level and the sample size.
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the mean, the confidence level, and the calculated confidence interval, which is represented as a list of two values (the lower and upper bounds). 

This function is essential for statistical analysis, providing insights into the reliability of sample estimates in relation to the overall population.
