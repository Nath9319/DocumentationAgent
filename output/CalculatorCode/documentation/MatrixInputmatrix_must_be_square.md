### MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square()

**Description:**
The `matrix_must_be_square` method is designed to validate that a given matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. This is a critical check for operations that require square matrices, such as certain mathematical computations in linear algebra.

**Parameters:**
- `matrix` (`list` of `list` of `float`): A two-dimensional list representing the matrix to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `matrix` should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix.
- All inner lists must be of equal length, and the number of inner lists (rows) must match the length of each inner list (columns).
- If the matrix is empty, it is considered non-square.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises a `ValueError` if the matrix is not square.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks the length of the outer list (number of rows).
- It then iterates through each inner list (row) to verify that its length matches the number of rows.
- If any row's length does not equal the number of rows, a `ValueError` is raised with a message indicating that the matrix must be square.
- This method utilizes the `len` function to determine the lengths of the lists and relies on the `ValueError` exception to handle invalid input gracefully.
