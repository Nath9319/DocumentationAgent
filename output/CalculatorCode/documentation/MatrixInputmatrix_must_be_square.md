### MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square()

**Description:**
The `matrix_must_be_square` method is designed to validate that a given matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. This is a crucial check in mathematical computations where square matrices are required, such as in certain linear algebra operations.

**Parameters:**
- `matrix` (`list` of `list` of `float`): A two-dimensional list representing the matrix to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `matrix` should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix.
- The matrix must contain only numerical values (e.g., integers or floats).
- The method assumes that the input is a well-formed list of lists, but it will raise an error if the matrix is not square.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises a `ValueError` if the matrix is not square.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks the length of the outer list (number of rows) and compares it to the length of each inner list (number of columns).
- If the number of rows does not equal the number of columns, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the matrix must be square.
- The method utilizes the `len` function to determine the dimensions of the matrix and relies on the `ValueError` exception to handle invalid input gracefully.
- This method is typically called during the initialization or processing of matrix-related operations to ensure that subsequent calculations can proceed without errors related to matrix dimensions.
