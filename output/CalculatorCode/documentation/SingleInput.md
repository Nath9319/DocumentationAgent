### SingleInput

**Description:**
The `SingleInput` class serves as a model for operations that require a single numeric input. It is designed to encapsulate the behavior and properties associated with handling a single number, making it suitable for various mathematical or computational tasks that necessitate one input value.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
The `SingleInput` class expects a single numeric value to be processed. This value should be of a type that is compatible with mathematical operations, such as an integer or a float. There are no specific constraints mentioned, but it is implied that the input should be a valid number.

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return any value directly; it is a model that may be used in conjunction with other methods or classes).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `SingleInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may utilize or override methods and properties defined in the base class.
- While the specific methods and logic of `SingleInput` are not detailed in the provided context, it is likely that this class includes functionality to validate the input number, perform operations on it, or provide additional features such as serialization or representation.
- The class is intended to be part of a larger framework where single numeric inputs are a common requirement, potentially interacting with other classes or functions that perform calculations or transformations based on the input value.
