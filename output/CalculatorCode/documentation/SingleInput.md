### SingleInput

**Description:**
The `SingleInput` class serves as a model for operations that require a single numeric input. It is designed to encapsulate the behavior and properties associated with handling a single number, facilitating various mathematical or computational operations that depend on this input.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to work with a single numeric value, which can be an integer or a float. The input should be validated to ensure it is a number, as the operations performed by this class will depend on numerical computations.

**Returns:**
- None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `SingleInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionalities and properties common to all models in the application. This inheritance suggests that `SingleInput` may utilize or override methods from `BaseModel` to implement specific behaviors related to single numeric inputs.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic for operations that require only one input, which may include mathematical calculations, validations, or transformations.
- While the specific methods and internal logic are not detailed in the provided information, it is implied that the class will include mechanisms to handle the input number effectively, ensuring that it can be processed for various operations as needed.
