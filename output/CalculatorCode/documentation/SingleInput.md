# Documentation for `SingleInput`

### SingleInput

**Description:**
The `SingleInput` class serves as a model for operations that require a single numerical input. It is designed to encapsulate the behavior and properties associated with handling a single number, providing a structured way to manage operations that depend on this input.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `SingleInput` class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to work with a single numerical value. This could be an integer or a float, depending on the specific operations that will be performed using this class. There are no explicit constraints mentioned, but typical usage would imply that the input should be a valid number.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return any values upon instantiation. However, it is likely designed to provide methods that will return results based on the single input number.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `SingleInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may leverage or extend functionalities provided by the base class. The specific logic and methods of the `SingleInput` class are not detailed in the provided context, but it is implied that it will include operations that manipulate or utilize the single numerical input in various ways.
- The class is likely to include methods for validating the input, performing calculations, or transforming the input number, although these specifics are not provided in the current documentation. The interaction with `BaseModel` may also introduce additional behaviors or properties that enhance the functionality of `SingleInput`.
