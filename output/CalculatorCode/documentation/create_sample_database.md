### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**
The `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently by generating its own sample data and creating a database.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if a directory for storing the CSV file exists; if not, it creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.
- It then generates a sample DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame` class, which contains predefined housing data.
- This DataFrame is saved to a CSV file using the `df.to_csv` method.
- Before creating the SQLite database, the function checks if a previous database file exists. If it does, it removes the old file using `os.remove` to ensure a fresh start.
- A new SQLite database connection is established using `sqlite3.connect`, and a cursor object is created to execute SQL commands.
- The function creates a table in the database to hold the housing data.
- It then loads the data from the CSV file into the SQLite table using the `df.to_sql` method.
- Finally, the function closes the database connection with `conn.close`, ensuring that all changes are saved and resources are released. Throughout the process, it handles potential errors using `sqlite3.Error` to maintain robustness.
