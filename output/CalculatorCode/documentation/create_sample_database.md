### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**
The `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing the sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not take any parameters or require any external input. It operates independently by generating its own sample data and creating a database.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value. Instead, it performs actions that result in the creation of a database file and a populated table.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **CSV File Generation**: The function begins by generating a CSV file that contains sample housing data. This data is structured in a way that is suitable for database storage.
  
2. **Directory Management**: It checks if the directory for storing the CSV file exists. If it does not, the function creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.

3. **File Existence Check**: Before creating a new CSV file, the function checks if a file with the same name already exists. If it does, the function removes the existing file using `os.remove` to avoid conflicts.

4. **DataFrame Creation**: The sample data is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame, which provides a convenient structure for data manipulation and export.

5. **CSV Export**: The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method, making the data available for database insertion.

6. **Database Connection**: The function establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`. If the database does not exist, it will be created.

7. **Table Creation**: A cursor object is created to execute SQL commands. The function constructs a SQL statement to create a table that matches the structure of the DataFrame.

8. **Data Insertion**: The function uses the `to_sql` method of the DataFrame to insert the data into the newly created table within the SQLite database.

9. **Error Handling**: Throughout the process, the function is prepared to handle any SQLite errors that may arise, ensuring robustness.

10. **Connection Closure**: Finally, the database connection is closed using `conn.close`, ensuring that all resources are properly released. 

This function encapsulates the entire workflow of creating a sample database, from data generation to database population, making it a useful utility for testing and development purposes.
