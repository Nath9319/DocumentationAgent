# Documentation for `create_sample_database`

### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**
The `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
The function does not take any input parameters. It operates with predefined sample data that is generated within the function itself.

**Returns:**
None: The function does not return any value. It performs operations that result in the creation of a database and a CSV file.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **CSV File Generation:** The function begins by creating a DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame` method, which contains sample housing data. This DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file using the `df.to_csv` method.
   
2. **Directory Creation:** It checks if the directory for storing the CSV file exists using `os.path.exists`. If it does not exist, it creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.

3. **Database Connection:** The function establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`. If the database file already exists, it is removed using `os.remove` to ensure a fresh start.

4. **Table Creation:** A cursor object is created using `conn.cursor`, which is used to execute SQL commands. The function executes a SQL command to create a new table for storing the housing data.

5. **Data Insertion:** The function populates the newly created table with data from the CSV file using the `df.to_sql` method, which facilitates the insertion of DataFrame data into the SQL table.

6. **Error Handling:** Throughout the process, the function is designed to handle potential SQLite errors by catching `sqlite3.Error` exceptions.

7. **Connection Closure:** Finally, the database connection is closed using `conn.close`, ensuring that all resources are properly released.

This function encapsulates the entire workflow of creating a sample database, from data generation to database population, making it a useful utility for testing and development purposes.
