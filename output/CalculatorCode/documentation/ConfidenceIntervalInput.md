### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class serves as a model for calculating confidence intervals in statistical analysis. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to define the parameters for a confidence interval calculation, ensuring that the data is structured and validated appropriately for further statistical processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `confidence_level` (`float`): Represents the confidence level for the interval, typically expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.95 for 95% confidence).
- `sample_mean` (`float`): The mean value derived from the sample data, which serves as the center point of the confidence interval.
- `sample_size` (`int`): The number of observations in the sample, which is crucial for determining the variability and reliability of the confidence interval.

**Expected Input:**
- `confidence_level` should be a float between 0 and 1, indicating the desired level of confidence.
- `sample_mean` should be a float representing the average of the sample data.
- `sample_size` should be a positive integer, as it represents the count of data points in the sample.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value directly; instead, it initializes an instance that can be used for further calculations related to confidence intervals.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model validation and data handling.
- Upon instantiation, the class validates the input parameters to ensure they conform to the expected types and constraints (e.g., checking that the confidence level is within the range of 0 to 1).
- The class may include methods for calculating the actual confidence interval based on the provided attributes, although these methods are not detailed in the provided information.
- The design of this class allows for easy integration into larger statistical analysis workflows, where confidence intervals are a common requirement.
