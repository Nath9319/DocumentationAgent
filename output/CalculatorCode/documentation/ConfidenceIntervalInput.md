### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class serves as a model for calculating confidence intervals. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to perform statistical calculations related to confidence intervals, providing a structured way to manage input data and parameters.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not explicitly define parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle input data relevant to confidence interval calculations, which typically includes sample data, confidence level, and possibly other statistical parameters. The exact nature of the input data is not specified in the provided context, but it should conform to the requirements of statistical analysis.

**Returns:**
- None (The class itself does not return values but is designed to facilitate the calculation of confidence intervals).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class likely inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may utilize or override methods and properties defined in the `BaseModel` class. This inheritance allows it to leverage existing functionality related to data validation, serialization, or other model behaviors.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic necessary for managing the input required for confidence interval calculations. This may include methods for setting and retrieving input values, validating the data, and preparing it for further statistical processing.
- The specific algorithms or calculations performed by this class are not detailed in the provided context, but it is expected to interact with statistical functions or libraries to compute the confidence intervals based on the input data it manages.
