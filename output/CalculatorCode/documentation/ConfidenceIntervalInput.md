# Documentation for `ConfidenceIntervalInput`

### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class serves as a model for calculating confidence intervals in statistical analysis. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to define the parameters for confidence interval calculations, ensuring that the input data is structured and validated appropriately.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `confidence_level` (`float`): Represents the confidence level for the interval, typically expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence level).
- `sample_mean` (`float`): The mean value of the sample data used in the confidence interval calculation.
- `sample_size` (`int`): The number of observations in the sample, which is crucial for determining the margin of error.
- `standard_deviation` (`float`): The standard deviation of the sample data, which is used to calculate the variability of the sample mean.

**Expected Input:**
- `confidence_level` should be a float between 0 and 1, representing the desired confidence level.
- `sample_mean` should be a float that indicates the average of the sample data.
- `sample_size` should be a positive integer, representing the number of data points in the sample.
- `standard_deviation` should be a non-negative float, indicating the dispersion of the sample data.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value directly but provides a structured way to hold and validate the input data for confidence interval calculations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for data validation and model behavior.
- Upon instantiation, the class attributes are set based on the provided input parameters, ensuring that they conform to the expected types and constraints.
- The class may include methods for further processing or validation of the input data, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.
- The design of this class facilitates the encapsulation of all necessary parameters for confidence interval calculations, promoting clean and maintainable code within the larger application.
