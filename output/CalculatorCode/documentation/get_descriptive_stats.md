# Documentation for `get_descriptive_stats`

### get_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is designed to retrieve and calculate descriptive statistics for a given dataset. It serves as an endpoint in the API, allowing clients to request statistical summaries such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other relevant metrics. This function leverages a service layer to perform the calculations and returns the results in a structured format.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects input data to be provided through the API request body. This data should be in a format compatible with the statistical calculations, typically a list or array of numerical values. The specifics of the input format may depend on the implementation of the `stats_svc.calculate_descriptive_stats` function.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics. The keys of the dictionary may include metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and others, depending on the implementation of the underlying service.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon invocation, the function is registered as a POST endpoint using the `router.post` decorator, indicating that it will handle HTTP POST requests.
- It utilizes the `Depends` mechanism to inject dependencies, which may include authentication, validation, or other services required for processing the request.
- The function calls `stats_svc.calculate_descriptive_stats`, passing the input data received from the API request. This service function is responsible for performing the actual statistical calculations.
- The results from `calculate_descriptive_stats` are then returned to the client in a structured JSON format, allowing for easy consumption by the client application.
- If any errors occur during processing, the function may raise an `APIException`, which is designed to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the client.
