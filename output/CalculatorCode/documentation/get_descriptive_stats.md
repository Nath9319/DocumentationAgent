### get_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is designed to retrieve and compute descriptive statistics for a given dataset. It serves as an endpoint in an API, allowing clients to submit data and receive statistical insights, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. The function leverages a service layer to perform the calculations, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which descriptive statistics are to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a list containing numerical values (floats). It is expected that the list is non-empty; otherwise, the statistical calculations may not be valid. The function may also handle edge cases, such as lists with identical values, which could affect the mode calculation.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, including:
- `mean`: The average of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value when the dataset is sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
- `variance`: A measure of the data's spread.
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation, indicating how much the values deviate from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure it meets the expected criteria.
- It then calls the `calculate_descriptive_stats` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the input data to compute the required statistics.
- The results from the `StatsService` are formatted into a dictionary structure, which is then returned to the client.
- If any errors occur during processing, such as invalid data types or empty lists, the function raises an `APIException` with an appropriate status code and detail message, ensuring that clients receive clear feedback on any issues encountered.
