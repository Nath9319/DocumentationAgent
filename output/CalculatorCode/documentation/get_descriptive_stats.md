### get_descriptive_stats(data: List[float]) -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is designed to compute and return a set of descriptive statistics for a given list of numerical data. It serves as an endpoint in an API, allowing clients to retrieve statistical insights such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation from the provided dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers for which the descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The list must contain numerical values, and it is expected that the list has sufficient data points to compute meaningful statistics (e.g., at least one number for mean and standard deviation calculations).

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, which includes:
- `mean`: The average of the numbers in the list.
- `median`: The middle value when the numbers are sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring number in the list.
- `variance`: A measure of how much the numbers vary from the mean.
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation, indicating the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure it meets the expected format and constraints.
- It then calls the `calculate_descriptive_stats` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the input list of numbers.
- The `calculate_descriptive_stats` method performs the actual computation of the statistics using NumPy and SciPy libraries, which provide efficient implementations for statistical calculations.
- Finally, the results are returned as a dictionary, structured to provide easy access to each of the computed statistics.
- If any errors occur during the processing, the function may raise an `APIException`, ensuring that clients receive a structured error response in case of issues.
