### CalculationError

**Description:**
`CalculationError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors that occur during calculation processes within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised and caught specifically when calculation-related issues arise, providing clearer error handling and debugging capabilities.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from the base exception class).

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to be instantiated with a message string that describes the error. This message can be any string that provides context about the calculation error encountered.

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return a value; it serves as an exception type).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, utilizing the `super().__init__` method to initialize the base exception with a custom message.
- When raised, this exception can be caught in a try-except block, allowing developers to handle calculation errors gracefully and provide feedback to users or log the error for further investigation.
- The class does not implement any additional methods or properties, relying on the standard behavior of exceptions in Python.
