### CalculationError

**Description:**
`CalculationError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors specifically related to calculation processes within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised in scenarios where a calculation fails due to invalid input or other unforeseen issues.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is typically used in conjunction with error messages or other exception handling mechanisms that provide context about the calculation failure.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class inherits from a base exception class, utilizing the `super().__init__` method to initialize the exception. This allows it to integrate seamlessly into Python's exception handling framework.
- When raised, it can provide a specific error message that describes the nature of the calculation error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- This class is intended to be used within the broader application to signal calculation-related issues, ensuring that such errors can be caught and handled appropriately by the calling code.
