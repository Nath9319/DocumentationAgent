### FinancialService

**Description:**
The `FinancialService` class provides a set of methods for performing common financial calculations, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library. This class is designed to facilitate various financial computations such as future value, present value, and payment calculations, making it a useful tool for financial analysis and planning.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
The methods within the `FinancialService` class expect numerical inputs that represent financial values, such as amounts of money, interest rates, and time periods. The specific requirements for each method may vary, but generally, inputs should be:
- Numeric types (integers or floats) representing monetary values or rates.
- Positive values for amounts and time periods.
- Interest rates should be expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).

**Returns:**
The methods of the `FinancialService` class return numerical values (floats) that represent the results of the financial calculations performed. The specific return values depend on the method invoked:
- Future value calculations return the total value of an investment after a specified period.
- Present value calculations return the current worth of a future sum of money.
- Payment calculations return the fixed periodic payment amount required to amortize a loan.

**Detailed Logic:**
The `FinancialService` class utilizes functions from the `numpy_financial` library to perform its calculations:
- **Future Value (`npf.fv`)**: This function calculates the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate. The class method that calls this function will typically require inputs such as the interest rate, number of periods, and payment amount.
- **Present Value (`npf.pv`)**: This function computes the present value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return. The method will require inputs like the future value, interest rate, and number of periods.
- **Payment (`npf.pmt`)**: This function calculates the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan based on the principal, interest rate, and number of payments. The corresponding method will take inputs such as the principal amount, interest rate, and total number of payments.

Overall, the `FinancialService` class serves as a centralized service for executing essential financial calculations, streamlining the process for users and ensuring accurate results through the use of established financial formulas.
