### FinancialService

**Description:**
The `FinancialService` class is designed to facilitate common financial calculations, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library. It provides methods to compute various financial metrics such as future value, present value, and periodic payments, which are essential for financial analysis and decision-making.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
The class does not require any specific input upon instantiation. However, the methods within the class will expect numerical inputs relevant to financial calculations, such as principal amounts, interest rates, and time periods.

**Returns:**
The methods within the `FinancialService` class return numerical values representing financial metrics, such as future value, present value, or payment amounts, depending on the specific method invoked.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FinancialService` class utilizes functions from the `numpy_financial` library, specifically `npf.fv`, `npf.pv`, and `npf.pmt`, to perform its calculations.
- `npf.fv` is used to calculate the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.
- `npf.pv` computes the present value of a series of future payments, allowing users to understand the current worth of future cash flows.
- `npf.pmt` calculates the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan over a specified number of payments, factoring in the loan amount and interest rate.
- The class methods will typically involve validating input parameters, invoking the appropriate `numpy_financial` functions, and returning the computed financial metrics to the caller. 

This class serves as a centralized service for performing essential financial calculations, making it easier for developers to integrate financial functionalities into their applications.
