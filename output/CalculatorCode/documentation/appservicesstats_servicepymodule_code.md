# Documentation for `app\services\stats_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a foundational component within the `stats_service.py` file, which is part of the applicationâ€™s service layer dedicated to statistical analysis. This module is likely responsible for initializing or configuring the `StatsService` class, enabling it to perform data retrieval and statistical computations effectively.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- None: This module does not directly accept input parameters as it primarily sets up the environment for the `StatsService` class.

**Returns:**
None: The module does not return any values directly.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` is responsible for defining the context in which the `StatsService` operates. It may include necessary imports, configurations, or initializations required for the statistical analysis functionalities.
- This module interacts with the `StatsService` class, which connects to a SQLite database, retrieves data, and performs statistical computations using libraries such as NumPy and SciPy.
- The logic within this module ensures that the `StatsService` is properly set up to handle data processing tasks, including establishing database connections and preparing data for analysis.
- While the specific implementation details of `module_code` are not provided, it is essential for the overall functionality of the `StatsService`, facilitating its role in statistical data analysis.
