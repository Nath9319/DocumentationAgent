# Documentation for `app\services\stats_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as an entry point for the statistical functionalities provided by the `StatsService` class. It is responsible for initializing the service layer that interacts with the SQLite database, facilitating data retrieval and statistical analysis. This module encapsulates the logic required to set up the `StatsService` and manage its operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not directly accept input parameters. However, it is expected to be used in conjunction with a valid SQLite database path, which will be provided to the `StatsService` class during its instantiation.

**Returns:**
`None`: The module does not return any values directly. Its primary purpose is to initialize and configure the `StatsService` for subsequent data analysis tasks.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module initializes the `StatsService` class by providing it with the necessary database path. This involves creating an instance of `StatsService`, which subsequently establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
- Upon initialization, the `StatsService` retrieves data from the database and loads it into a pandas DataFrame, preparing it for statistical analysis.
- The module may also include additional setup or configuration logic to ensure that the `StatsService` operates correctly within the application context.
- The `StatsService` instance created by this module will be utilized to perform various statistical computations, such as calculating means, medians, and performing t-tests, leveraging external libraries like NumPy and SciPy for efficient processing.
