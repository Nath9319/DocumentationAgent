### ValidationService

**Description:**
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex, cross-service validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid against the actual data stored in the system. This service plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and consistency across the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, used to retrieve data from various sources, such as databases, to facilitate validation processes.
  
**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` class does not take specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it relies on the methods of the `DataService` to fetch data, which requires valid database paths and table names as input when performing validations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. It initializes an object that can be used for performing validations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ValidationService` utilizes the `DataService` to access data from a SQLite database, leveraging its method `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` to retrieve data tables as pandas DataFrames.
- It performs various validation checks on the data, ensuring that the input adheres to the expected formats and logical constraints defined by the application’s business rules.
- The service may interact with other classes, such as `RegressionInput` and `CorrelationInput`, to validate the structure and integrity of the data being processed for regression analysis or correlation computations.
- Error handling is a key aspect of the validation process, with the service raising custom exceptions (like `DataError`) when it encounters issues related to data integrity or validation failures.
- The overall goal of the `ValidationService` is to ensure that all data interactions within the application are valid and reliable, thereby preventing potential errors downstream in the data processing pipeline.
