### ValidationService

**Description:**
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex validations that extend beyond simple field checks within models. It integrates with the data layer to ensure that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid when compared against the actual data stored in the system. This service is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that operations involving data are valid and reliable.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:** The class does not define any specific attributes in the provided code segment. However, it is expected to utilize instances of the `DataService` class to perform its validation tasks.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` class expects input data that is structured according to the requirements of the specific validation being performed. This may include data models or raw data that need to be validated against existing records in the database. The specifics of the input format are likely defined by the methods within the class.

**Returns:**
- The class does not return values directly upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods that may return validation results or raise exceptions if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ValidationService` class relies heavily on the `DataService` to retrieve data from various sources, particularly from SQLite databases. It utilizes the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method from `DataService` to load data into pandas DataFrames, which are then used for validation checks.
- The class is structured to handle multiple types of validations, likely including checks for data consistency, integrity, and logical correctness based on business rules.
- When performing validations, the service may compare incoming data against existing records, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met before allowing further processing.
- If any validation checks fail, the class is expected to raise appropriate exceptions, such as `DataError`, to indicate the nature of the validation failure, allowing for clear error handling and debugging.
- Overall, the `ValidationService` acts as a crucial intermediary between incoming requests and the data layer, ensuring that all data manipulations are valid and adhere to the defined business logic.
