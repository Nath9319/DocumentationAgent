# Documentation for `ValidationService`

### ValidationService

**Description:**
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex, cross-service validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid in relation to the actual data stored in the system. This service plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and consistency across different components of the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, used to interact with the data layer and retrieve data for validation purposes.
- `regression_input` (`RegressionInput`): An instance of the `RegressionInput` class, representing the input data for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis.
- `correlation_input` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the `CorrelationInput` class, representing the input data for generating a correlation matrix.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` expects instances of `RegressionInput` and `CorrelationInput` to be provided for validation. These instances should contain the necessary data structured appropriately for their respective analyses.
- The `data_svc` should be a properly initialized instance of `DataService`, capable of loading data from the specified sources.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods that perform validation checks and may raise exceptions if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ValidationService` class initializes with instances of `DataService`, `RegressionInput`, and `CorrelationInput`, setting up the necessary components for validation.
- It includes methods that leverage the `data_svc` to retrieve data from the database or files, which is then used to validate the input data against existing records.
- The class employs validation logic to ensure that the input data adheres to the expected formats and constraints, such as checking for distinct variables in `RegressionInput` and ensuring sufficient columns in `CorrelationInput`.
- If any validation checks fail, the class raises appropriate exceptions, such as `DataError`, to signal issues with the input data.
- The service is designed to provide informative error messages, aiding developers in identifying and resolving validation issues efficiently.
- Overall, the `ValidationService` acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only logically valid data is processed further in the application, thus enhancing the robustness and reliability of the system.
