### CorrelationInput

**Description:**
The `CorrelationInput` class serves as a model for managing a correlation matrix. It ensures that when specified, at least two columns of data are provided, thereby enforcing a fundamental requirement for correlation analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `columns` (`list`): A list of column names or identifiers that will be used in the correlation matrix. This attribute is essential for defining the structure of the correlation input.

**Expected Input:**
- The `columns` attribute must be a list containing at least two elements when specified. If the input does not meet this requirement, a `ValueError` will be raised, indicating that the correlation matrix cannot be computed with insufficient data.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that can be used to represent and manipulate correlation matrix data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `CorrelationInput` class may utilize the `BaseModel` from an external library to inherit common model functionalities.
- The class likely employs the `field_validator` to enforce validation rules on the `columns` attribute, ensuring that the input meets the minimum requirement of having at least two columns.
- If the validation fails, a `ValueError` is raised, providing feedback to the user about the nature of the input error.
- The class is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the application that require correlation matrix data, ensuring data integrity and adherence to statistical requirements.
