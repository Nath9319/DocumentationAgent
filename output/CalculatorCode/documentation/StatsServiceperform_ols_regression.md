### StatsService.perform_ols_regression() -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality. It computes the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the regression model, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.

**Parameters:**
- `None`: This method does not take any parameters directly. It relies on internal data loaded via the `_load_data` method.

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects that the data required for regression analysis has been previously loaded and is accessible through the class instance. The data should be structured appropriately, typically as a two-dimensional array or matrix for the independent variables (features) and a one-dimensional array for the dependent variable (target).

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding values:
- `coefficients`: A list of regression coefficients for each independent variable.
- `intercept`: The intercept of the regression line.
- `r_squared`: The coefficient of determination, indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.
- `p_values`: A list of p-values corresponding to each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of each predictor.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **Data Loading**: The method begins by loading the necessary data using the `_load_data` method, which retrieves the independent and dependent variables for the regression analysis.
  
2. **Matrix Preparation**: It constructs the design matrix `X` by stacking the independent variables and adding a column of ones to account for the intercept term.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**: The method uses NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq` function to compute the least squares solution, which provides the regression coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared residuals.

4. **Predictions and Residuals**: It calculates the predicted values by multiplying the design matrix `X` with the computed coefficients. The residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) are then computed.

5. **R-squared Calculation**: The method calculates the R-squared value by determining the proportion of variance explained by the model, using the total sum of squares and the residual sum of squares.

6. **P-value Calculation**: To assess the significance of the coefficients, the method computes p-values using the t-distribution. It involves calculating the standard errors of the coefficients and using them to derive the t-statistics, which are then used to find the corresponding p-values.

7. **Summary Dictionary**: Finally, the method compiles the coefficients, intercept, R-squared, and p-values into a summary dictionary, which is returned as the output of the method.

This method leverages several external libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations and statistical calculations, ensuring efficient and accurate computations throughout the regression analysis process.
