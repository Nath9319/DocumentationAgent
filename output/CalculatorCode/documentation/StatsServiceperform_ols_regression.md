### StatsService.perform_ols_regression() -> dict

**Description:**
This method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality, without relying on external statistical libraries like statsmodels. It computes the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
The method expects the following data to be loaded internally via `self._load_data`:
- A dataset containing independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) suitable for regression analysis. The independent variables should be in a format that can be processed by NumPy, typically a 2D array or matrix, while the dependent variable should be a 1D array.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A summary dictionary containing the following keys:
- `coefficients`: The estimated coefficients for each independent variable.
- `intercept`: The estimated intercept of the regression line.
- `r_squared`: The coefficient of determination, indicating the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- `p_values`: The p-values associated with each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of the predictors.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **Data Loading**: The method begins by loading the necessary data using `self._load_data`, which retrieves the dataset for analysis.
2. **Matrix Preparation**: It constructs the design matrix `X` by stacking the independent variables and adding a column of ones to account for the intercept.
3. **Coefficient Calculation**: Using NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq`, the method calculates the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals between the observed and predicted values.
4. **Predictions**: The predicted values are computed by multiplying the design matrix `X` with the calculated coefficients.
5. **Residuals and R-squared Calculation**: The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) are computed, and the R-squared value is calculated to assess the model's fit.
6. **Standard Error and P-values**: The method calculates the standard errors of the coefficients and subsequently computes the p-values using the t-distribution from `stats.t.cdf`, which helps in determining the significance of each predictor.
7. **Summary Compilation**: Finally, the method compiles all the computed statistics into a summary dictionary and returns it.

This method provides a straightforward implementation of OLS regression, leveraging NumPy for efficient numerical computations while avoiding the complexity of additional statistical libraries.
