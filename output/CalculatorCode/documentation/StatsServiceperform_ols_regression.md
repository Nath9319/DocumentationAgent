### StatsService.perform_ols_regression() -> dict

**Description:**
This method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality, bypassing the need for external libraries like statsmodels. It computes the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values, returning these metrics in a summary dictionary.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method relies on data loaded through the `self._load_data` method, which is expected to return a dataset suitable for regression analysis. The dataset should include both independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) in a format compatible with NumPy operations.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding values:
- `coefficients`: A NumPy array of the regression coefficients for each independent variable.
- `intercept`: A float representing the intercept of the regression line.
- `r_squared`: A float indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- `p_values`: A NumPy array of p-values corresponding to each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of each predictor.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **Data Loading**: The method begins by loading the dataset using `self._load_data`, which is expected to return a structured dataset containing both independent and dependent variables.
   
2. **Matrix Preparation**: It constructs the design matrix `X` by stacking the independent variables and adding a column of ones to account for the intercept. This is achieved using `np.column_stack`.

3. **OLS Calculation**: The method computes the regression coefficients using NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq`, which solves the least squares problem. This function returns the coefficients that minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals.

4. **Predictions and Residuals**: It calculates the predicted values by multiplying the design matrix `X` with the computed coefficients. The residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) are then determined.

5. **R-squared Calculation**: The method computes the R-squared value, which measures the goodness of fit of the model. This is done by comparing the sum of squares of the residuals to the total sum of squares of the dependent variable.

6. **P-value Calculation**: To assess the statistical significance of the coefficients, the method calculates p-values using the t-distribution. This involves computing the standard errors of the coefficients and then determining the p-values based on the t-statistics.

7. **Summary Dictionary**: Finally, the method compiles the coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values into a dictionary and returns it, providing a comprehensive summary of the regression analysis results.
