### ValidationService.validate_correlation_inputs(payload: CorrelationInput)

**Description:**
The `validate_correlation_inputs` method is responsible for validating the inputs required for performing a correlation analysis. It ensures that the specified columns exist within the provided data and that these columns contain numeric values. This validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors during subsequent analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the Pydantic model that encapsulates the input data for correlation analysis, including the columns to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` must be a valid instance of the `CorrelationInput` model, which should contain a list of column names that are intended for correlation analysis. The columns specified must exist in the data source and must be of a numeric type.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Instead, it raises an exception if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by extracting the column names from the `payload` object.
- It retrieves the relevant dataset from a SQLite database using the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method from the `DataService`. This dataset is returned as a pandas DataFrame.
- The method checks if all specified columns exist in the DataFrame. If any column is missing, it raises a `DataError` indicating which columns are not found.
- Next, it verifies that each of the specified columns contains numeric data types. This is done using the `select_dtypes` method from pandas, which filters the DataFrame to include only numeric columns. If any of the specified columns are not numeric, a `DataError` is raised, providing feedback on which columns failed the validation.
- By performing these checks, the method ensures that the data is suitable for correlation analysis, thus preventing potential runtime errors during analysis execution.
