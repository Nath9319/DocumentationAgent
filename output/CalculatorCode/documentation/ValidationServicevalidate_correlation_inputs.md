### ValidationService.validate_correlation_inputs(payload: CorrelationInput)

**Description:**
The `validate_correlation_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data required for performing correlation analysis. It ensures that the specified columns exist within the provided data and that these columns contain numeric data types. This validation is crucial for preventing runtime errors during the correlation computation.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the Pydantic model that encapsulates the input data for correlation analysis, including the columns to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` should be a valid `CorrelationInput` object, which must include a list of column names that are intended for correlation analysis. The columns specified in the payload must exist in the data source and must be of a numeric data type (e.g., integers or floats).

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Instead, it performs validation checks and raises exceptions if the checks fail.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the data from a specified source, likely a SQLite database, using the `self.data_svc.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method. This method connects to the database and returns the relevant table as a pandas DataFrame.
- It then checks if the columns specified in the `payload` exist within the DataFrame. If any of the specified columns are missing, a `DataError` is raised, indicating which columns are not found.
- Following the existence check, the method verifies that all specified columns are numeric. This is accomplished using the `select_dtypes` method from pandas, which filters the DataFrame to include only numeric types. If any of the specified columns are found to be non-numeric, a `DataError` is raised, detailing which columns failed the numeric check.
- By encapsulating these validation checks, the method ensures that only valid input data is processed for correlation analysis, thereby enhancing data integrity and reducing the likelihood of errors during subsequent computations.
