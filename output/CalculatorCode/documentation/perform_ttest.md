### perform_ttest() -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ttest` function is designed to execute a statistical independent two-sample t-test. This test evaluates whether the means of two independent samples are significantly different from each other. It leverages the `perform_independent_ttest` method from the `StatsService` class to carry out the computation and return the results.

**Parameters:**
- `sample1` (`list` or `numpy.ndarray`): The first sample of data for the t-test.
- `sample2` (`list` or `numpy.ndarray`): The second sample of data for the t-test.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `sample1` and `sample2` should be either lists or numpy arrays containing numerical data. They must not be empty and should ideally represent independent samples from the same population.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the results of the t-test, specifically:
- `t_statistic` (`float`): The calculated t-statistic value from the t-test.
- `p_value` (`float`): The p-value associated with the t-test, indicating the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the input samples to ensure they meet the expected criteria (i.e., they are non-empty lists or numpy arrays).
- It then calls the `perform_independent_ttest` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the two samples as arguments.
- The `perform_independent_ttest` method computes the t-statistic and p-value using the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module, which performs the independent two-sample t-test.
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the t-statistic and p-value, providing the user with the results of the statistical test.
