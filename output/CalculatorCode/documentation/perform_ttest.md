### perform_ttest(sample1: list, sample2: list) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ttest` function conducts an independent two-sample t-test to compare the means of two samples. It assesses whether the means of the two groups are statistically different from each other, returning the t-statistic and the p-value associated with the test.

**Parameters:**
- `sample1` (`list`): The first sample data, which should be a list or a numpy array containing numerical values.
- `sample2` (`list`): The second sample data, which should also be a list or a numpy array containing numerical values.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `sample1` and `sample2` must be lists or numpy arrays containing numerical data. The samples can be of different lengths, and they do not need to have equal variance.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the results of the t-test, specifically:
- `t_statistic` (`float`): The calculated t-statistic value from the t-test.
- `p_value` (`float`): The p-value associated with the t-test, indicating the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `perform_independent_ttest` method from the `StatsService` class, which implements the independent two-sample t-test using the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module.
- It computes the t-statistic and p-value by passing the two samples to the `ttest_ind` function, with the `equal_var` parameter set to `False`, indicating that the function should not assume equal population variances.
- The results are returned as a dictionary containing the t-statistic and p-value, which can be used to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between the two sample means.
