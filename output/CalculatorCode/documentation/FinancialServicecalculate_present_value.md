### calculate_present_value(cash_flows: list, discount_rate: float) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the present value of a series of future cash flows, discounted at a specified rate. This method is essential for evaluating the worth of an investment by determining how much future cash flows are worth in today's terms.

**Parameters:**
- `cash_flows` (`list`): A list of floats representing the future cash flows expected from the investment. Each element in the list corresponds to a cash flow at a specific time period.
- `discount_rate` (`float`): The discount rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for a 5% discount rate). This rate is used to discount future cash flows back to their present value.

**Expected Input:**
- `cash_flows` should be a list containing numeric values (floats or integers) that represent the cash inflows or outflows at different time periods.
- `discount_rate` should be a non-negative float. A value of 0.0 indicates no discounting, while a positive value reflects the rate at which future cash flows are discounted.

**Returns:**
`float`: The present value of the future cash flows, representing the total worth of the investment in today's currency.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `npf.pv` function from the external library to perform the present value calculation. This function takes the discount rate and the series of cash flows as inputs.
- It applies the present value formula, which discounts each cash flow back to its present value based on the specified discount rate.
- The final output is the sum of all discounted cash flows, providing a single value that represents the present worth of the investment. This calculation is crucial for financial analysis, investment decision-making, and comparing the value of different investment opportunities.
