### calculate_present_value(future_value: float, annual_rate: float, periods: int) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the present value of an investment based on a specified future value, annual interest rate, and the number of periods until the future value is realized. This method utilizes the net present value formula to determine how much a future sum of money is worth today.

**Parameters:**
- `future_value` (`float`): The amount of money to be received in the future.
- `annual_rate` (`float`): The annual interest rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
- `periods` (`int`): The total number of periods (years, months, etc.) until the future value is received.

**Expected Input:**
- `future_value` should be a positive float representing the amount expected in the future.
- `annual_rate` should be a non-negative float (0.0 means no interest).
- `periods` should be a positive integer indicating the number of periods until the future value is realized.

**Returns:**
`float`: The present value of the future sum, representing how much that future amount is worth in today's terms.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method leverages the `npf.pv` function from the external library to perform the present value calculation.
- It takes the provided `annual_rate` and `periods` to compute the present value using the formula that discounts the future value back to the present.
- The calculation accounts for the time value of money, reflecting how the value of money decreases over time due to factors like inflation and opportunity cost.
- The method ensures that the inputs are valid and appropriately formatted for the calculation to yield accurate results.
