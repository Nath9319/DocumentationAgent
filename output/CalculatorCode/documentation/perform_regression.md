### perform_regression(db_path: str, table_name: str, dependent_var: str, independent_vars: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]

**Description:**
The `perform_regression` function conducts a regression analysis on a specified dataset. It validates the input data to ensure that the necessary columns exist and are numeric, and then performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using the validated data. The function returns a summary of the regression results, including coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the independent variables.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the database from which the data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table in the database that contains the data for regression analysis.
- `dependent_var` (`str`): The name of the dependent variable (the outcome variable) for the regression.
- `independent_vars` (`List[str]`): A list of names for the independent variables (predictor variables) used in the regression analysis.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to a SQLite database file.
- `table_name` should be a string that corresponds to an existing table within the database.
- `dependent_var` must be a string that matches a column name in the specified table.
- `independent_vars` should be a list of strings, each representing a column name in the table that will be used as predictors. All specified variables must exist in the table and be of numeric type.

**Returns:**
`Dict[str, Any]`: A dictionary containing the regression summary, which includes:
- `coefficients`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their respective coefficients.
- `standard_errors`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their standard errors.
- `t_statistics`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their t-statistics.
- `p_values`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their p-values.
- `r_squared`: A float representing the R-squared value of the regression model.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. The function begins by validating the regression inputs using the `validate_regression_inputs` method from the `ValidationService`. This step ensures that the specified columns exist in the database and are numeric.
2. If validation passes, the function retrieves the relevant data from the database using the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method, which loads the data into a DataFrame.
3. It constructs the design matrix `X` by adding a column of ones (for the intercept) to the independent variables and extracts the dependent variable `y`.
4. The function then performs OLS regression using NumPy's least squares method, calculating the coefficients and residuals.
5. It computes various statistics, including the mean squared error, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values for each coefficient.
6. Finally, it calculates the R-squared value to assess the goodness of fit for the model and compiles all results into a summary dictionary, which is returned to the caller. 

This function integrates error handling through the `APIException` class, ensuring that any issues encountered during execution are communicated effectively to the API client.
