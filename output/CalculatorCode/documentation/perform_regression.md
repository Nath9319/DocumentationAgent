### perform_regression(payload: RegressionInput)

**Description:**
The `perform_regression` function orchestrates the process of validating input data for regression analysis and subsequently performing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. It ensures that the necessary columns exist in the specified database table and that they are numeric before executing the regression analysis. The function returns a summary of the regression results, including coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model containing the request data, which includes the database path, table name, dependent variable, and independent variables for the regression analysis.

**Expected Input:**
- `payload` should be an instance of `RegressionInput`, which must contain:
  - `db_path`: A string representing the path to the database.
  - `table_name`: A string indicating the name of the table containing the data.
  - `dependent_var`: A string specifying the name of the dependent variable.
  - `independent_vars`: A list of strings representing the names of the independent variables.
- The columns specified in `dependent_var` and `independent_vars` must exist in the database table and must be of numeric type.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A summary dictionary containing the results of the regression analysis, including:
- `coefficients`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their corresponding coefficients.
- `standard_errors`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their standard errors.
- `t_statistics`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their t-statistics.
- `p_values`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their p-values.
- `r_squared`: A float representing the R-squared value of the regression.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. The function begins by validating the input data using the `validate_regression_inputs` method from the `ValidationService`. This method checks that the specified columns exist in the database and are numeric.
2. Upon successful validation, the function retrieves the data from the specified database table using the `StatsService.perform_ols_regression` method.
3. It constructs the design matrix `X` by including a column of ones for the intercept and the values of the independent variables.
4. The function then applies NumPy's least squares method to compute the regression coefficients and other statistics.
5. Finally, it compiles the results into a summary dictionary and returns it, providing a comprehensive overview of the regression analysis outcomes. 

This function integrates multiple services to ensure robust validation and execution of regression analysis, making it a critical component of the statistical analysis workflow within the application.
