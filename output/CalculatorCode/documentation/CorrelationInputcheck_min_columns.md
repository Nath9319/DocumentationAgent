### CorrelationInput.check_min_columns() -> None

**Description:**
The `check_min_columns` method is responsible for validating that the input data contains a minimum number of columns required for further processing. This method is crucial in ensuring that the data integrity is maintained before any calculations or analyses are performed.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects the input data to be structured in a way that it can be evaluated for the number of columns. Typically, this would be a DataFrame or similar structure where the number of columns can be easily counted.
- The method is likely to be called within a context where the data has already been loaded and is ready for validation.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to perform its validation checks. This validator is likely designed to enforce specific rules regarding the structure of the input data.
- If the input data does not meet the minimum column requirement, the method raises a `ValueError`. This exception indicates that the data is insufficient for the intended operations, prompting the user to provide a more complete dataset.
- The method's primary role is to act as a safeguard, ensuring that any subsequent operations on the data can be performed without encountering errors related to insufficient data structure.
