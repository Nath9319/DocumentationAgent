### CorrelationInput.check_min_columns() -> None

**Description:**
The `check_min_columns` method is responsible for validating that the input data contains a minimum number of columns required for further processing. This method ensures that the data structure meets the necessary criteria before any correlation calculations are performed.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects the input data to be structured in a way that it can be assessed for the number of columns. Typically, this would be a DataFrame or similar data structure where the number of columns can be easily counted.
- The method may raise a `ValueError` if the input data does not meet the minimum column requirement, indicating that the data is insufficient for the intended calculations.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes a field validation mechanism to check the number of columns in the input data.
- It compares the actual number of columns against a predefined minimum threshold.
- If the number of columns is less than the required minimum, a `ValueError` is raised, providing feedback to the user about the inadequacy of the input data.
- This validation step is crucial for ensuring that subsequent operations that depend on the presence of sufficient data can be executed without errors.
