# Documentation for `CorrelationInput.check_min_columns`

### CorrelationInput.check_min_columns() -> None

**Description:**
The `check_min_columns` method is responsible for validating that a given input meets the minimum column requirements necessary for further processing within the `CorrelationInput` class. This method ensures that the data structure being evaluated contains an adequate number of columns to perform correlation calculations, thereby preventing runtime errors that could arise from insufficient data.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on an internal data structure (likely a DataFrame or similar object) that is expected to be passed to the `CorrelationInput` class. The specific structure and content of this data are not defined within the method itself, but it is implied that the data should be organized in a tabular format with multiple columns.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by checking the number of columns in the input data structure.
- It compares this count against a predefined minimum threshold, which is likely set as a class attribute or constant.
- If the number of columns is below this threshold, the method raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the input does not meet the necessary requirements for processing.
- This validation step is crucial for ensuring that subsequent operations that depend on the presence of sufficient data can proceed without encountering errors related to inadequate input. The method does not return any value; its primary function is to enforce data integrity through validation.
