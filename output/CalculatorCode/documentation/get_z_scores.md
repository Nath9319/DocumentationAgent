# Documentation for `get_z_scores`

### get_z_scores() -> List[float]

**Description:**
The `get_z_scores` function is designed to calculate the z-scores for a given dataset. Z-scores are statistical measurements that describe a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. This function processes input data, computes the z-scores using a dedicated service, and returns the results in a structured format.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the z-scores are to be calculated. This input is expected to be a list of floats representing the dataset.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a list containing numerical values (floats or integers). The list must not be empty, as z-scores cannot be computed without a mean and standard deviation. If the input data is invalid (e.g., non-numeric values or an empty list), the function may raise an `APIException`.

**Returns:**
`List[float]`: A list of calculated z-scores corresponding to the input data. Each z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure it is a non-empty list of numerical values.
- It then calls the `calculate_z_scores` method from the `stats_svc` service, passing the validated data for processing.
- The `calculate_z_scores` method computes the z-scores based on the statistical properties of the dataset (mean and standard deviation).
- Finally, the function returns the list of z-scores to the caller, allowing for further analysis or reporting.

This function is part of an API endpoint and is typically invoked in response to a POST request, leveraging the `router.post` decorator to handle incoming requests and dependencies.
