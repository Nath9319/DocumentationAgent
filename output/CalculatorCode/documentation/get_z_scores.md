### get_z_scores(data: List[float]) -> List[float]

**Description:**
The `get_z_scores` function calculates the Z-scores for a given list of numerical data. Z-scores are statistical measures that describe a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values, indicating how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. This function leverages the `calculate_z_scores` method from the `StatsService` class to perform the computation.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers for which the Z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The list must contain numerical values, and it is expected that the list has more than one element to compute meaningful Z-scores. An empty list or a list with a single element may lead to undefined behavior or errors.

**Returns:**
`List[float]`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input data. Each Z-score indicates how many standard deviations each value in the input list is from the mean of the list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the input to ensure that it is a non-empty list of floats.
- It then calls the `calculate_z_scores` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the input data to it.
- The `calculate_z_scores` method computes the Z-scores by subtracting the mean of the data from each value and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the data. The results are rounded to four decimal places.
- Finally, the function returns the list of calculated Z-scores, providing a standardized measure of the input data's distribution. 

This function is essential for statistical analysis, particularly in scenarios where understanding the relative position of data points within a dataset is necessary.
