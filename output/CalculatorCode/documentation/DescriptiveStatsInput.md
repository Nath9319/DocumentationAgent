# Documentation for `DescriptiveStatsInput`

### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
`DescriptiveStatsInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of descriptive statistics. It serves as a structured input container for the necessary data required to perform statistical analysis, ensuring that the data is organized and accessible for further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which descriptive statistics will be calculated. This attribute is essential for the operations performed by the class.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list of floating-point numbers. It is expected that the list contains valid numerical values, and it should not be empty, as descriptive statistics require at least one data point to compute meaningful results.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it prepares the input data for subsequent statistical calculations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality and structure for the model.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the input data necessary for calculating descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- Upon initialization, the class takes a list of numerical values and stores it in the `data` attribute, making it available for any methods that may be defined within the class or inherited from `BaseModel`.
- The class does not perform any calculations itself; rather, it serves as a data structure that can be utilized by other components of the application to compute descriptive statistics based on the provided input.
