### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class serves as a model for calculating descriptive statistics. It is designed to encapsulate the necessary input data required for performing various statistical analyses, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values representing the dataset for which descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list of floating-point numbers. It is expected that the list contains valid numerical entries, and it should not be empty, as descriptive statistics cannot be computed on an empty dataset.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that holds the input data for further statistical processing.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `DescriptiveStatsInput` class initializes with a list of numerical values provided as input.
- The class is likely to inherit from `BaseModel`, which may provide additional functionality or validation mechanisms for the data.
- The primary role of this class is to serve as a structured input for subsequent calculations of descriptive statistics, ensuring that the data is organized and accessible for further processing.
- The class does not perform any calculations itself but acts as a container for the input data, which can be utilized by other functions or methods that perform the actual statistical computations.
