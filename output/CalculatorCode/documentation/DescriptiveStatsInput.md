### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class serves as a model for calculating descriptive statistics. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to perform statistical analysis on a given dataset, providing a structured way to manage input data for such calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values representing the dataset for which descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list of floating-point numbers. It is expected that the list contains valid numerical entries, and it should not be empty, as descriptive statistics require a dataset to compute meaningful results.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that can be used to perform further calculations related to descriptive statistics.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model representation, such as validation and serialization.
- Upon creation of an instance of `DescriptiveStatsInput`, the provided dataset is stored in the `data` attribute.
- The class is designed to facilitate the calculation of various descriptive statistics (such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation) by providing a structured way to manage and validate the input data.
- The interaction with `BaseModel` may include methods for data validation and ensuring that the input adheres to expected formats and types, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.
