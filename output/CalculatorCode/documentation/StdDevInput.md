### StdDevInput

**Description:**
`StdDevInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of the standard deviation of a dataset. It serves as a structured representation of input data, ensuring that the necessary parameters for standard deviation computation are properly defined and validated.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated. This attribute is essential for the class's functionality.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (floats or integers). The list must not be empty, as standard deviation cannot be computed without at least one data point. Additionally, all elements in the list should be numbers to ensure valid calculations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value directly. Instead, it prepares the data for further processing, such as invoking methods that compute the standard deviation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `StdDevInput` initializes the `data` attribute with the provided list of numerical values.
- The class may include methods to validate the input data, ensuring it meets the criteria for standard deviation calculation (e.g., checking for non-empty lists and numerical types).
- The class is likely designed to work in conjunction with other components of the codebase that perform the actual computation of standard deviation, leveraging the structured input it provides.
- It inherits from `BaseModel`, which may offer additional functionality or validation mechanisms, enhancing the robustness of the `StdDevInput` class. 

This class is a foundational element in the overall architecture for statistical calculations, specifically focusing on standard deviation, and is intended to be used within a broader context of data analysis or mathematical modeling.
