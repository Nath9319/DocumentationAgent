### StdDevInput

**Description:**
The `StdDevInput` class serves as a model for calculating the standard deviation of a dataset. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to perform this statistical calculation, providing a structured approach to handle input data and compute the standard deviation.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated. This attribute is essential for the computation and must contain valid numerical entries.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list of floats, representing the numerical dataset. It is expected that the list contains at least one number to compute a meaningful standard deviation. If the list is empty, the calculation may not be valid.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value directly. Instead, it provides methods to compute and retrieve the standard deviation based on the input data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `StdDevInput` class inherits from the `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality and structure for model classes within the application.
- Upon instantiation, the class expects a list of numerical values to be passed as input.
- The class may include methods to calculate the mean of the dataset, which is a prerequisite for determining the standard deviation.
- The standard deviation is computed using the formula that involves the mean and the squared differences from the mean, which is a common statistical approach.
- The class is designed to facilitate easy integration with other components of the application, potentially allowing for further statistical analysis or data manipulation as needed.
