# Documentation for `StdDevInput`

### StdDevInput

**Description:**
`StdDevInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of the standard deviation of a dataset. It serves as a structured input mechanism, likely encapsulating the necessary data and methods to perform standard deviation calculations efficiently.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (The class does not explicitly define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle a list of numerical values, which will be used to compute the standard deviation. The input data should be in a format compatible with the calculations, typically a list of floats or integers.

**Returns:**
None (The class itself does not return a value; it is intended to be used as part of a larger calculation process).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `StdDevInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, suggesting that it may leverage or extend the functionality provided by this base class, which could include data validation, serialization, or other model-related behaviors.
- The class likely includes methods to process the input data, compute the mean, and subsequently calculate the standard deviation based on the statistical formula.
- The interaction with the `List` type indicates that the class is designed to work with collections of numerical data, ensuring that operations can be performed on these lists to derive the standard deviation.
- The implementation may involve iterating over the list to compute necessary statistics, such as the mean, before applying the standard deviation formula. 

This class is a foundational component in the broader context of statistical calculations, providing a clear interface for inputting data and performing standard deviation calculations.
