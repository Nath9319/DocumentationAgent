### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component within the `statistics.py` file, which is part of the API's version 1 endpoints. This module is primarily responsible for defining and managing the routes related to statistical operations within the application. It leverages the `APIRouter` from an external library to facilitate the creation of RESTful API endpoints that handle requests for statistical data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not directly accept input parameters as it primarily sets up routes for handling incoming API requests. However, the endpoints defined within this module will expect specific data formats and structures based on the API's design, which may include JSON objects, query parameters, or path variables.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of `APIRouter`, which is used to define various API endpoints related to statistics.
- It sets up routes that correspond to different statistical operations, such as retrieving statistical summaries or performing calculations based on user-provided data.
- Each route is associated with a specific handler function that processes incoming requests, validates input data, performs necessary computations, and returns the appropriate response.
- The module may also include middleware or dependency injections to handle authentication, logging, or error handling, ensuring that the API operates smoothly and securely.
- Overall, `module_code` acts as a facilitator for organizing and managing the statistical endpoints, ensuring that they are accessible and functional within the broader application context.
