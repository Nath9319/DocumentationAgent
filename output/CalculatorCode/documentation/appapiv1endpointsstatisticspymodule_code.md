# Documentation for `app\api\v1\endpoints\statistics.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central point for defining API endpoints related to statistical data within the application. It utilizes the `APIRouter` to facilitate the creation and management of routes that handle requests for statistical information, enabling structured access to various statistical functionalities.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of `APIRouter`, which is a component of the FastAPI framework designed to manage API routes efficiently.
- This module likely defines various endpoints that respond to HTTP requests, such as GET or POST, specifically tailored for statistical operations.
- It organizes the routing logic, allowing for easy integration of additional statistical features or modifications in the future.
- The endpoints defined within this module will interact with other components of the application, such as data processing functions or database queries, to retrieve and return statistical data to the client. 

Overall, `module_code` plays a crucial role in structuring the API for statistical endpoints, ensuring that the application can handle requests in a modular and maintainable manner.
