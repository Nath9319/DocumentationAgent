### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a part of the API routing mechanism within the FastAPI framework. It is responsible for defining and organizing the endpoints related to statistical operations in the application. This module acts as a central point for handling requests and responses associated with statistical data processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This module does not directly accept input parameters as it primarily sets up API routes. However, the endpoints defined within this module will expect specific input data formats (e.g., JSON) when invoked through HTTP requests.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` utilizes the `APIRouter` from the FastAPI framework to create a new router instance. This instance is used to define various statistical endpoints that can handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- Each endpoint defined within this module will typically include logic to process incoming requests, validate input data, and return appropriate responses, often involving statistical calculations or data retrieval.
- The module may also include middleware or dependencies that enhance the functionality of the endpoints, such as authentication or data validation.
- Overall, the `module_code` acts as a foundational component for the statistical API, ensuring that all related endpoints are properly registered and accessible within the application.
