### LoanPaymentInput

**Description:**
`LoanPaymentInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of loan payments. It serves as a structured representation of the input parameters required for loan payment calculations, ensuring that the data is validated and correctly formatted before any calculations are performed.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `amount` (`float`): The total amount of the loan. This value must be a positive number.
- `interest_rate` (`float`): The annual interest rate for the loan expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%). This value should be non-negative.
- `term` (`int`): The duration of the loan in months. This must be a positive integer representing the total number of payments to be made.

**Expected Input:**
- The `amount` should be a positive float indicating the loan principal.
- The `interest_rate` should be a non-negative float, where a value of 0.0 indicates no interest.
- The `term` should be a positive integer, representing the number of months over which the loan will be repaid.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but initializes an instance with the specified attributes.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `LoanPaymentInput` validates the input parameters to ensure they meet the required constraints (e.g., positive values for `amount` and `term`, and a non-negative value for `interest_rate`).
- The class likely inherits from `BaseModel`, which may provide additional functionality such as data validation or serialization.
- The attributes defined in this class are intended to be used in subsequent calculations related to loan payments, ensuring that all necessary information is encapsulated within a single object.
- The class may utilize the `Field` functionality from the external library to define the characteristics of each attribute, such as type, validation rules, and default values.
