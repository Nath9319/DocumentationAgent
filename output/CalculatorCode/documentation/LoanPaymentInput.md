### LoanPaymentInput

**Description:**
The `LoanPaymentInput` class serves as a model for calculating loan payments. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to represent and compute the details of a loan payment scenario, ensuring that all relevant data is structured and accessible for further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not explicitly define parameters or attributes in the provided context. However, it is expected to inherit attributes from its parent class, `BaseModel`, and may utilize fields defined by the `Field` library.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is designed to handle inputs related to loan payments, which may include attributes such as principal amount, interest rate, and payment term. The specific types and constraints of these inputs would typically be defined in the inherited attributes from `BaseModel` and any fields specified using the `Field` library.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides a structured representation of loan payment data that can be utilized by other components of the application.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `LoanPaymentInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for data modeling, including validation and serialization.
- It utilizes the `Field` library to define and manage its attributes, ensuring that the data adheres to specified types and constraints.
- The class is expected to include methods for calculating loan payments based on the attributes it holds, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.
- Overall, `LoanPaymentInput` acts as a structured data model that integrates with the broader loan calculation framework, facilitating the input and management of loan payment data.
