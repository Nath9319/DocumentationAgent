### ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs(payload: RegressionInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_regression_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data required for regression analysis. It connects to a database to ensure that the specified columns exist and are of a numeric type, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data before any regression analysis is performed. This method serves as a critical validation step, leveraging the `DataService` to retrieve the necessary data and perform checks on its structure and content.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data for regression analysis. This model includes the necessary fields that need to be validated against the database.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` must be an instance of `RegressionInput`, which should contain valid field names that correspond to the columns expected in the regression analysis. The fields specified in the `payload` should be present in the database table and must be numeric.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Instead, it raises exceptions if validation checks fail.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by utilizing the `DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` function to retrieve the relevant data from the SQLite database. This function fetches the entire table as a pandas DataFrame.
- Once the DataFrame is obtained, the method checks if each specified column from the `payload` exists in the DataFrame.
- For each column, it verifies that the data type is numeric using `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype`. If any column is missing or is not numeric, a `DataError` is raised, indicating the specific validation failure.
- Additionally, the method checks for any null values in the specified columns. If any null values are found, it raises a `DataError` to signal that the data is incomplete.
- This structured approach ensures that only valid and complete data is processed for regression analysis, thereby enhancing the reliability of the results.
