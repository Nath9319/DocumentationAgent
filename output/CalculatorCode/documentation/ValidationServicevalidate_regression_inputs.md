### ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs(payload: RegressionInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_regression_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data required for regression analysis. It connects to a database to ensure that the specified columns exist and are of a numeric type, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data before any regression analysis is performed.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data for regression analysis. This model includes the necessary attributes that need to be validated against the database.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` must be an instance of the `RegressionInput` model, which should contain fields that correspond to the expected columns in the database for regression analysis. The values in these fields should be structured in a way that they can be validated against the database schema.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by utilizing the `DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` function to retrieve the relevant data from a SQLite database. This function connects to the database and fetches the entire table as a pandas DataFrame.
- After obtaining the DataFrame, the method checks for the existence of the specified columns in the DataFrame. It verifies that these columns are present and that they contain numeric data types using the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function.
- If any of the validation checks fail—such as missing columns or non-numeric data types—the method raises a `DataError` exception. This custom exception provides a clear indication of the nature of the validation failure, allowing for appropriate error handling in the application.
- Overall, this method serves as a critical step in ensuring that the data used for regression analysis is valid and reliable, preventing potential errors during the analysis phase.
