### TTestInput

**Description:**
`TTestInput` is a model designed for performing an independent t-test, a statistical method used to determine if there are significant differences between the means of two independent samples. This class includes validation to ensure that the samples provided for the t-test are not identical, which is a prerequisite for the test's assumptions.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `sample1` (`List[float]`): The first sample of data points for the t-test.
- `sample2` (`List[float]`): The second sample of data points for the t-test.

**Expected Input:**
- `sample1` and `sample2` should be lists of floating-point numbers representing the data points of the two independent samples.
- Both samples must contain at least one data point.
- The samples must not be identical; if they are, a validation error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but raises exceptions if validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `TTestInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides foundational functionality for model validation.
- It utilizes the `Field` class to define the attributes `sample1` and `sample2`, ensuring they are appropriately typed and validated.
- The `field_validator` function is employed to implement custom validation logic that checks whether the two samples are identical. If they are found to be identical, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the samples do not meet the requirements for conducting an independent t-test.
- The class encapsulates the necessary data and validation logic, making it suitable for use in statistical analysis workflows where independent t-tests are required.
