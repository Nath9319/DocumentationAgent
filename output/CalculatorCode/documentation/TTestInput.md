### TTestInput

**Description:**
`TTestInput` is a model class designed to represent the input parameters for conducting an independent t-test. It ensures that the samples provided for the test are not identical, thereby validating the assumptions necessary for the t-test to be meaningful.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `sample1` (`list`): The first sample of data points to be tested.
- `sample2` (`list`): The second sample of data points to be tested.

**Expected Input:**
- `sample1` and `sample2` should be lists containing numerical values. 
- Both samples must contain at least one data point.
- The two samples must not be identical; if they are, a validation error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but raises validation errors if the input conditions are not met.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, `TTestInput` validates the provided samples. It checks if both samples are identical and raises a `ValueError` if they are, ensuring that the assumptions for the independent t-test are satisfied.
- The class leverages the `BaseModel` for foundational model behavior and utilizes `Field` for defining the attributes of the samples.
- The `field_validator` is employed to enforce the validation rules, ensuring that the samples meet the necessary criteria before any statistical analysis is performed.
