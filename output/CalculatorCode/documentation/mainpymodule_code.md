### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` in `main.py` serves as a central component of a FastAPI application, orchestrating the routing and handling of HTTP requests. It integrates various external libraries to facilitate web functionalities, including serving static files, rendering templates, and managing exceptions.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module is expected to handle HTTP requests directed at specific endpoints defined within the FastAPI application. The input will typically be in the form of HTTP requests, which may include query parameters, path variables, and request bodies depending on the defined routes.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` utilizes the FastAPI framework to define routes and manage incoming requests. It likely includes decorators such as `@app.get` to specify HTTP GET endpoints.
- It integrates `StaticFiles` to serve static assets (like CSS, JavaScript, and images) directly from the file system, enhancing the user interface of the web application.
- The `Jinja2Templates` library is employed for rendering HTML templates, allowing for dynamic content generation based on the data provided to the templates.
- Exception handling is managed through `app.exception_handler`, ensuring that any errors encountered during request processing are appropriately captured and responded to, providing a better user experience.
- The `JSONResponse` class is used to return JSON-formatted responses, which is essential for APIs that communicate with clients using JSON.
- The module may also include logic to include additional routers or endpoints, enhancing the modularity and scalability of the application.

Overall, `module_code` acts as a foundational layer for the FastAPI application, coordinating various functionalities and ensuring a seamless interaction between the client and server.
