### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` in `main.py` serves as a central component for setting up a FastAPI application. It integrates various external libraries to facilitate web application functionalities, including serving static files, rendering templates, and handling exceptions. This module is responsible for defining routes and managing the overall behavior of the web application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module expects to be part of a FastAPI application context, where it can receive HTTP requests and serve responses accordingly. It may also rely on specific configurations set up in the FastAPI application instance.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module utilizes the FastAPI framework to define routes that handle incoming HTTP requests. 
- It incorporates `StaticFiles` to serve static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, allowing the application to deliver a complete web experience.
- The `Jinja2Templates` library is employed for rendering HTML templates, enabling dynamic content generation based on user interactions or data.
- Exception handling is managed through `app.exception_handler`, which allows the application to gracefully respond to errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
- The `JSONResponse` class is used to return JSON data in response to API calls, ensuring that clients receive structured data.
- The `app.include_router` method is utilized to modularize the application by including additional route definitions from other modules, promoting code organization and reusability.
- The `app.get` decorator defines GET endpoints, allowing the application to respond to specific URL patterns with designated functions.
- Finally, `templates.TemplateResponse` is used to send rendered HTML templates back to the client, completing the request-response cycle for web pages.

Overall, `module_code` acts as a foundational setup for the FastAPI application, integrating various functionalities to create a robust web service.
