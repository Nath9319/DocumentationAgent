# Documentation for `main.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` is a component of a FastAPI application that serves as the main entry point for defining routes and handling HTTP requests. It integrates various functionalities such as serving static files, rendering templates, and managing error responses. This module is essential for setting up the web server and defining the behavior of the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module is expected to handle incoming HTTP requests, which may include query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies depending on the defined routes.
- It may also serve static files and render HTML templates based on the requests received.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module initializes a FastAPI application instance, which is the core of the web service.
- It utilizes `StaticFiles` to serve static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, allowing the application to deliver a complete web experience.
- The `Jinja2Templates` dependency is used to render HTML templates dynamically, enabling the application to generate web pages based on user input or data from the server.
- Error handling is managed through `app.exception_handler`, which allows the application to respond gracefully to exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the client.
- The `JSONResponse` class is employed to return JSON data in response to API requests, ensuring that the application can communicate effectively with clients expecting JSON-formatted data.
- The `app.include_router` method is used to modularize the application by including different routers, which can define specific sets of routes and their corresponding handlers.
- The `app.get` decorator is utilized to define GET endpoints, allowing the application to respond to HTTP GET requests with the appropriate data or rendered templates.
- Finally, `templates.TemplateResponse` is used to send rendered HTML templates back to the client, providing a seamless user experience.

This module serves as the backbone of the FastAPI application, coordinating various components and ensuring that the application can handle web requests efficiently.
