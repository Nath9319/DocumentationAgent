### TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical

**Description:**
This method is designed to validate that the samples provided to a test input are not identical. It ensures that the input data used for testing contains distinct values, which is crucial for the integrity and reliability of the testing process.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on the internal state of the `TTestInput` class, which is expected to contain a collection of sample data. The specific structure or type of this data is not detailed in the provided context, but it is implied that the samples should be iterable and comparable.

**Returns:**
- None: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises an exception if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes a `field_validator` to enforce the uniqueness of the samples. This validator checks the samples against a condition that ensures they are not identical.
- If the samples are found to be identical, the method raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the input is invalid. This exception serves as a mechanism to alert the user or calling function that the provided samples do not meet the required criteria for testing.
- The method is likely invoked during the initialization or validation phase of the `TTestInput` class, ensuring that any instance of this class is initialized with valid sample data.
