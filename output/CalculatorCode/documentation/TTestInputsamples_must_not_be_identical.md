### TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical

**Description:**
This method is designed to validate that the samples provided to a test input are not identical. It ensures that the input data used for testing contains distinct values, which is crucial for the integrity of statistical analyses and tests.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on the samples attribute of the `TTestInput` class, which is expected to be a collection (e.g., list or array) of numerical values. The collection should contain at least two elements for the validation to be meaningful.
- The method will raise a `ValueError` if the samples are identical or if there are fewer than two samples.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to enforce the validation rule.
- It checks the samples attribute of the `TTestInput` instance to determine if all values are the same.
- If the samples are found to be identical, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the samples must not be identical. This is critical for ensuring that statistical tests, such as t-tests, can be performed accurately and meaningfully.
