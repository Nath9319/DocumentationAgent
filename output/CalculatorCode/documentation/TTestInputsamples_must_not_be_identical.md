### TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical

**Description:**
The `samples_must_not_be_identical` method is a validation function designed to ensure that a set of input samples are not identical. This is crucial in statistical testing and analysis, where identical samples can lead to misleading results or errors in calculations.

**Parameters:**
- `samples` (`list`): A list of samples to be validated. This list is expected to contain numerical or categorical data.

**Expected Input:**
- The `samples` parameter should be a list containing at least two elements. Each element should represent a sample that can be compared against others in the list.
- The method will raise a `ValueError` if the list contains fewer than two samples or if all samples in the list are identical.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Instead, it raises an exception if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks the length of the `samples` list. If the list contains fewer than two samples, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that at least two samples are required for comparison.
- Next, it checks if all samples in the list are identical. This is typically done by converting the list to a set (which removes duplicates) and checking the length of the set. If the length of the set is 1, it implies that all samples are identical, and a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to enforce these validation rules, ensuring that the input adheres to the expected criteria before proceeding with further computations or analyses.
