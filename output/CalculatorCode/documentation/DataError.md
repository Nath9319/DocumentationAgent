# Documentation for `DataError`

### DataError

**Description:**
`DataError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling when data-related issues arise, such as invalid data formats or unexpected data types.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from the base exception class.)

**Expected Input:**
- The class is intended to be instantiated with a message string that describes the specific data error encountered. This message should provide context for the error to aid in debugging.

**Returns:**
- None (The class does not return a value; it raises an exception when instantiated.)

**Detailed Logic:**
- When an instance of `DataError` is created, it calls the constructor of its superclass using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that the base exception class is properly initialized, allowing the `DataError` instance to function as a standard exception while also carrying a specific message related to data errors.
- The primary purpose of this class is to provide a clear and distinct way to signal data-related issues, which can be caught and handled separately from other types of exceptions in the application. This enhances error handling and debugging capabilities by allowing developers to identify and respond to data errors specifically.
