### DataError

**Description:**
The `DataError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised in scenarios where data integrity or validity issues occur, providing a clear indication of the nature of the error.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
The `DataError` class does not take any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it can be raised with an optional message that describes the error in detail.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataError` class inherits from the built-in exception class, utilizing `super().__init__` to initialize the base exception with a custom message if provided.
- This class serves as a specialized exception that can be caught and handled separately from other general exceptions, allowing developers to implement specific error handling logic for data-related issues.
- By defining this custom exception, the codebase can maintain clarity and specificity in error reporting, making it easier to debug and manage data-related problems.
