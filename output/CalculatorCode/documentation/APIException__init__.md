# Documentation for `APIException.__init__`

### APIException.__init__(self, message: str, status_code: int)

**Description:**
The `APIException` class is designed to handle exceptions that occur within the API layer of the application. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `APIException` class, allowing for the specification of an error message and an associated HTTP status code.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the exception. This message is intended to inform the user or developer about the nature of the error.
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception. This code helps to categorize the error (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).

**Expected Input:**
- `message` should be a non-empty string that clearly describes the error encountered.
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically an integer between 100 and 599.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `APIException`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method begins by calling the `__init__` method of its parent class using `super()`, ensuring that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the exception hierarchy.
- The `message` and `status_code` parameters are then assigned to instance attributes, allowing them to be accessed later when the exception is raised or logged.
- This method does not perform any validation on the inputs; it assumes that the caller will provide appropriate values. The handling of the exception is typically managed elsewhere in the application, where the `APIException` is raised.
