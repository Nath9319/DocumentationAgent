### APIException.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

**Description:**
The `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur within the API context. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of this exception, allowing for the inclusion of additional context or information related to the error.

**Parameters:**
- `*args`: Variable length argument list that can include any positional arguments intended for the exception message.
- `**kwargs`: Variable length keyword arguments that can include additional context or attributes relevant to the exception.

**Expected Input:**
- The `*args` parameter can accept any number of positional arguments, typically strings that describe the error.
- The `**kwargs` parameter can accept any number of keyword arguments that may provide further details about the exception, such as error codes or additional metadata.

**Returns:**
None: This method does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `APIException` to inherit standard exception behavior.
- By passing `*args` and `**kwargs` to the superclass, the method allows for flexible error messaging and additional context, making it easier to provide detailed information about the error when the exception is raised.
- This design pattern enhances the usability of the exception, enabling developers to create more informative and context-rich error messages when handling API-related issues.
