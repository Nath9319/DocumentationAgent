### APIException.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

**Description:**
The `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur within the API layer of the application. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of this exception, allowing for the inclusion of additional context or information when the exception is raised.

**Parameters:**
- `*args`: Variable length argument list that can include any positional arguments intended for the base exception class.
- `**kwargs`: Variable length keyword arguments that can include any keyword arguments intended for the base exception class.

**Expected Input:**
- The `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters are expected to be passed when raising the exception. They should conform to the expected input for the base exception class, which may include a message string or other relevant data that provides context about the error.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the base exception class is executed, allowing the `APIException` to inherit all the properties and behaviors of standard exception classes.
- By utilizing `*args` and `**kwargs`, the method provides flexibility in how the exception can be instantiated, enabling the inclusion of various types of error messages or additional context as needed.
- This design allows for consistent error handling across the API, making it easier to manage and debug issues that arise during API interactions.
