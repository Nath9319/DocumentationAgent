# Documentation for `app\services\validation_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a foundational component within the `validation_service.py` file, which is part of the applicationâ€™s service layer. This module is responsible for orchestrating the validation processes that ensure incoming data adheres to the required business rules and data integrity standards. It leverages the capabilities of the `ValidationService` class to perform complex validations against existing data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The module is designed to handle structured input data that aligns with the validation requirements defined within the `ValidationService`. This input may include various data models or raw data formats that need to be validated against the database records.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` interacts with the `ValidationService` class to facilitate the validation of incoming requests. It is expected to utilize the methods provided by `ValidationService` to perform checks against the data layer.
- The validation process typically involves retrieving data from a database using the `DataService`, specifically through methods like `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, which loads data into pandas DataFrames for validation checks.
- The module is structured to ensure that all necessary validation conditions are met before any further processing of the data occurs. If any validation fails, appropriate exceptions (such as `DataError`) are raised to signal the nature of the failure, allowing for effective error handling and debugging.
- Overall, `module_code` acts as an intermediary that ensures data integrity and compliance with business logic before any operations are performed on the data.
