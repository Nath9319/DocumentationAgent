### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, indicating how much the individual numbers in the dataset deviate from the mean.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numerical values. The list must not be empty, as standard deviation cannot be computed for an empty dataset. It is also recommended that the list contains at least two numbers to provide a meaningful measure of variability.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the provided list of numbers, representing the average distance of each number from the mean of the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `np.std` method from the NumPy library to compute the standard deviation. 
- It first checks the input to ensure it is a valid list of numbers.
- The `np.std` function calculates the standard deviation by determining the mean of the numbers, then computing the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
- The result is returned as a floating-point number, which quantifies the spread of the dataset.
