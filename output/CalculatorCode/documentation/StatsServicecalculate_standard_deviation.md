# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_standard_deviation`

### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, providing insight into the distribution of the data points relative to the mean.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list containing numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a non-empty list of numerical values. The list can contain integers and/or floats. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return a specific value (this should be confirmed in the implementation).

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the provided list of numbers, representing the dispersion of the data points from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `np.std` method from the NumPy library to compute the standard deviation. 
- It first checks the input list to ensure it contains valid numerical data.
- The `np.std` function calculates the standard deviation by determining the mean of the list, then computing the square root of the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- The result is returned as a floating-point number, which indicates how spread out the numbers in the list are around the mean value.
