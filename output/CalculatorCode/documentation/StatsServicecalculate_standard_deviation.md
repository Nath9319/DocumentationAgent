### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a given list of numbers. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numerical values. It is expected to be non-empty, as the standard deviation cannot be calculated for an empty list. The list can contain both integers and floating-point numbers.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the provided list of numbers, representing the degree of variation from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `np.std` function from the NumPy library to compute the standard deviation. 
- It first checks the input list to ensure it is not empty, as an empty list would lead to an undefined standard deviation.
- The `np.std` function is called with the list of numbers, which calculates the standard deviation using the formula that considers the mean of the numbers and their deviations from it.
- The result is then returned as a floating-point number, representing the calculated standard deviation for the input list.
