### FutureValueInput

**Description:**
The `FutureValueInput` class serves as a model for calculating the future value of an investment or cash flow. It is responsible for validating cash flow conventions, ensuring that the input data adheres to the expected formats and constraints necessary for accurate future value calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not take any parameters upon instantiation. Instead, it defines attributes that are validated internally.

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects attributes related to cash flow, such as amounts and time periods, to be set after instantiation. These attributes must conform to specific validation rules defined within the class to ensure they are appropriate for future value calculations.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it provides methods to retrieve validated attributes and perform calculations based on those attributes.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FutureValueInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model validation and data handling.
- It utilizes the `Field` class to define its attributes, which may include properties like cash flow amounts and time periods.
- The class employs the `field_validator` to enforce validation rules on its attributes, ensuring that inputs meet specific criteria (e.g., non-negative values for cash flows).
- If any validation fails, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating the nature of the input error.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic required for future value calculations, allowing for easy integration with other components of the application that require future value computations.
