### FutureValueInput

**Description:**
The `FutureValueInput` class serves as a model for calculating the future value of an investment or cash flow. It is responsible for validating the conventions associated with cash flows, ensuring that the inputs conform to expected standards before any calculations are performed.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not take any parameters directly upon instantiation. Instead, it utilizes attributes defined within the class for its operations.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is designed to handle inputs related to cash flows, which may include amounts, rates, and time periods. Specific constraints on these inputs are enforced through validation methods, ensuring that they adhere to financial conventions (e.g., non-negative values for cash flows).

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any values directly. Instead, it provides methods that may return calculated future values based on validated inputs.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FutureValueInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model validation and data handling.
- It employs the `Field` class to define attributes related to cash flow inputs, which may include fields for amounts, interest rates, and time periods.
- The class utilizes `field_validator` to enforce validation rules on these fields, ensuring that inputs meet specific criteria (e.g., checking for non-negative cash flows).
- If any validation fails, a `ValueError` is raised, providing feedback on the nature of the input error.
- Overall, the class encapsulates the logic necessary for preparing and validating data required for future value calculations, ensuring that any subsequent computations are based on accurate and valid inputs.
