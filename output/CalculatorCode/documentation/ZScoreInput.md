### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
The `ZScoreInput` class is designed to handle input data for Z-score calculations, which are commonly used in statistical analysis to determine how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. This class extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, providing a structured way to manage and validate the input data necessary for Z-score computations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided lines.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class is expected to receive data that conforms to the structure defined by its parent class, `BaseModel`. This typically includes a list of numerical values that will be used to calculate the Z-scores. The input data should be validated to ensure it is suitable for statistical analysis, meaning it should not contain non-numeric values or be empty.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any values directly. Instead, it serves as a data structure to hold and potentially validate input data for further processing.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which implies that it may utilize methods and properties defined in the `BaseModel` for data management and validation.
- The class is likely to include methods for setting and retrieving input data, as well as for performing any necessary validation checks to ensure that the data is appropriate for Z-score calculations.
- While the specific logic and methods are not detailed in the provided lines, it is expected that the class will facilitate the preparation of data for subsequent statistical operations, possibly including methods to compute the mean and standard deviation, which are essential for calculating Z-scores. 

Overall, `ZScoreInput` acts as a foundational component for managing input data in statistical applications, ensuring that the data is structured and validated before it is used in calculations.
