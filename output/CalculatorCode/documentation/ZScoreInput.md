### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
The `ZScoreInput` class is designed to facilitate the calculation of Z-scores, which are statistical measures that describe a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. This class likely extends functionality from a base model, providing a structured way to input and process data necessary for Z-score calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class is expected to handle data inputs that can be processed to compute Z-scores. This typically includes numerical datasets, which may be provided as lists or arrays. The class may impose constraints on the type of data (e.g., ensuring that the input is numeric) and the structure (e.g., non-empty lists).

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value directly upon instantiation. Instead, it is likely used as part of a larger workflow where methods within the class will perform calculations and return results.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class inherits from the `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may leverage methods and properties defined in the base class for data handling and validation.
- The class is expected to include methods that process input data, calculate the mean and standard deviation, and subsequently compute the Z-scores for the provided dataset.
- Interaction with the `List` type indicates that the class may utilize lists to store input data or intermediate results, ensuring compatibility with Python's type hinting and enhancing code readability.
- The specifics of the Z-score calculation, including how the class handles edge cases (such as empty datasets or non-numeric inputs), would be defined in the methods of the class, although these details are not provided in the current context.
