### StatsService.perform_independent_ttest(sample1: Union[List[float], np.ndarray], sample2: Union[List[float], np.ndarray]) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
The `perform_independent_ttest` method conducts an independent two-sample t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent samples. This statistical test is commonly used in hypothesis testing to compare the means of two groups.

**Parameters:**
- `sample1` (`Union[List[float], np.ndarray]`): The first sample, which can be provided as a list of floats or a NumPy array.
- `sample2` (`Union[List[float], np.ndarray]`): The second sample, which can also be provided as a list of floats or a NumPy array.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `sample1` and `sample2` should contain numerical data (floats) representing the observations of the two independent groups being compared.
- The input samples must not be empty and should ideally have a similar variance for the assumptions of the t-test to hold true.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two values:
- The first element is the t-statistic, which indicates the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data.
- The second element is the p-value, which helps determine the statistical significance of the observed difference.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `ttest_ind` function from the `stats` module of an external library to perform the t-test.
- It first checks the input samples to ensure they are valid (i.e., not empty).
- The `ttest_ind` function is called with `sample1` and `sample2` as arguments, which computes the t-statistic and p-value based on the provided samples.
- The results (t-statistic and p-value) are then returned as a tuple, allowing the caller to interpret the significance of the test results.
