### StatsService.perform_independent_ttest(sample1: Union[List[float], np.ndarray], sample2: Union[List[float], np.ndarray]) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
The `perform_independent_ttest` method conducts an independent two-sample t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent samples. This method leverages the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` library to perform the statistical test.

**Parameters:**
- `sample1` (`Union[List[float], np.ndarray]`): The first sample of data, which can be provided as a list of floats or a NumPy array.
- `sample2` (`Union[List[float], np.ndarray]`): The second sample of data, which can also be provided as a list of floats or a NumPy array.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `sample1` and `sample2` should be either lists or NumPy arrays containing numerical data (floats).
- Each sample should contain at least two data points to perform the t-test.
- The samples should be independent of each other.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two values:
- The first element is the t-statistic, which indicates the ratio of the difference between the group means to the variability of the groups.
- The second element is the p-value, which indicates the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by validating the input samples to ensure they are either lists or NumPy arrays.
- It then calls the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` library, passing in the two samples.
- The `ttest_ind` function computes the t-statistic and the p-value for the independent two-sample t-test.
- Finally, the method returns the t-statistic and p-value as a tuple, allowing the caller to interpret the results of the statistical test.
