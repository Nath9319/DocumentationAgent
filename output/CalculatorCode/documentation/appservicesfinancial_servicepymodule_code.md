# Documentation for `app\services\financial_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central point for financial calculations within the `FinancialService` class. It encapsulates the logic necessary to perform various financial computations, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library. This module is designed to streamline the process of executing essential financial calculations, such as future value, present value, and payment calculations, thereby aiding users in financial analysis and planning.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
The methods within the `module_code` expect numerical inputs that represent financial values. These inputs typically include:
- Numeric types (integers or floats) representing monetary values, interest rates, and time periods.
- Positive values for amounts and time periods.
- Interest rates should be expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).

**Returns:**
The methods within the `module_code` return numerical values (floats) that represent the results of the financial calculations performed. The specific return values depend on the method invoked:
- Future value calculations return the total value of an investment after a specified period.
- Present value calculations return the current worth of a future sum of money.
- Payment calculations return the fixed periodic payment amount required to amortize a loan.

**Detailed Logic:**
The `module_code` utilizes functions from the `numpy_financial` library to perform its calculations:
- **Future Value Calculation**: It employs the `npf.fv` function to compute the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate. The method typically requires inputs such as the interest rate, number of periods, and payment amount.
- **Present Value Calculation**: The `npf.pv` function is used to determine the present value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows, given a specified rate of return. The method requires inputs like the future value, interest rate, and number of periods.
- **Payment Calculation**: The `npf.pmt` function calculates the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan based on the principal, interest rate, and number of payments. The corresponding method takes inputs such as the principal amount, interest rate, and total number of payments.

Overall, the `module_code` acts as a facilitator for executing essential financial calculations, ensuring accurate results through the use of established financial formulas and providing a user-friendly interface for financial analysis.
