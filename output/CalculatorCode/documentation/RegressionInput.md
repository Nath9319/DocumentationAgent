### RegressionInput

**Description:**
The `RegressionInput` class serves as a model for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It is designed to ensure that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing issues that may arise from multicollinearity. This class encapsulates the necessary attributes and validation logic required for preparing data for OLS regression.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `dependent_variable` (`Field`): Represents the dependent variable in the regression model. It must be distinct from the independent variables.
  - `independent_variables` (`List[Field]`): A list of independent variables used in the regression. Each variable must be distinct from one another and from the dependent variable.
  
**Expected Input:**
- The `dependent_variable` must be a valid field that is distinct from all entries in `independent_variables`.
- The `independent_variables` must be a list of valid fields, ensuring that no two variables in this list are the same, and that none of them match the `dependent_variable`.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that can be used for further regression analysis.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `RegressionInput` class validates the provided `dependent_variable` and `independent_variables` to ensure that they are distinct. This is crucial for the integrity of the regression analysis.
- The class leverages external libraries such as `Field` for defining the structure of the variables and `field_validator` for implementing the validation logic.
- If the validation fails (e.g., if any variables are not distinct), a `ValueError` is raised, indicating the nature of the input error.
- The class does not perform any regression calculations itself but serves as a preparatory step for ensuring that the data is suitable for OLS regression analysis.
