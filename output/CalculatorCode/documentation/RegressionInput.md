# Documentation for `RegressionInput`

### RegressionInput

**Description:**
The `RegressionInput` class serves as a model for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It is designed to ensure that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing issues that may arise from multicollinearity or redundancy among the variables.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any parameters or attributes explicitly in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `RegressionInput` class is expected to handle input data that consists of distinct variables suitable for OLS regression. This typically includes numerical or categorical data that can be transformed into a numerical format. The class may enforce constraints to ensure that no two variables are identical.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it is used to create an object that encapsulates the input data for regression analysis.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `RegressionInput` class likely inherits from a base model class (`BaseModel`), which may provide foundational functionality for data validation and manipulation.
- It utilizes the `Field` and `field_validator` components to define and validate the input fields, ensuring that the variables are distinct.
- If any input validation fails (e.g., if duplicate variables are detected), the class may raise a `ValueError`, signaling that the input does not meet the required criteria for OLS regression.
- The class is structured to facilitate the preparation of data for regression analysis, ensuring that the integrity of the input variables is maintained throughout the process.
