### RegressionInput

**Description:**
The `RegressionInput` class serves as a model for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It is designed to ensure that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing issues that may arise from multicollinearity. This class is a part of a larger framework that likely involves statistical modeling and data analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:** The class does not explicitly define any attributes in the provided information. However, it is expected to inherit attributes from its parent class, `BaseModel`, which may include various properties related to the model's configuration and data handling.

**Expected Input:**
- The `RegressionInput` class is expected to receive distinct variable inputs for regression analysis. These inputs should be structured in a way that adheres to the requirements of OLS regression, meaning that each variable must be independent and not correlated with others. The specifics of the input format are likely defined in the parent class or through the use of external libraries.

**Returns:**
- The class does not return any values directly. Instead, it serves as a structured representation of the input data for regression analysis, which can be utilized by other components of the application.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `RegressionInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model management, including data validation and processing.
- The class utilizes the `Field` and `field_validator` from external libraries to define and validate the input fields. This ensures that the data conforms to the expected types and constraints.
- The class may raise a `ValueError` if the input variables do not meet the distinctness requirement, ensuring robust error handling and data integrity.
- Overall, the class encapsulates the logic necessary to prepare and validate input data for OLS regression, allowing for seamless integration with other components of the statistical analysis framework.
