Documentation may be incomplete.\n### create_sample_database() -> None\n\n**Description:**\nThe `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing the sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.\n\n**Parameters:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The function does not take any parameters or require any external input. It operates independently by generating its own sample data and creating a database.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: The function does not return any value. Instead, it performs actions that result in the creation of a database file and a populated table.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n1. **CSV File Generation**: The function begins by generating a CSV file that contains sample housing data. This data is structured in a way that is suitable for database storage.\n  \n2. **Directory Management**: It checks if the directory for storing the CSV file exists. If it does not, the function creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.\n\n3. **File Existence Check**: Before creating a new CSV file, the function checks if a file with the same name already exists. If it does, the function removes the existing file using `os.remove` to avoid conflicts.\n\n4. **DataFrame Creation**: The sample data is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame, which provides a convenient structure for data manipulation and export.\n\n5. **CSV Export**: The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method, making the data available for database insertion.\n\n6. **Database Connection**: The function establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`. If the database does not exist, it will be created.\n\n7. **Table Creation**: A cursor object is created to execute SQL commands. The function constructs a SQL statement to create a table that matches the structure of the DataFrame.\n\n8. **Data Insertion**: The function uses the `to_sql` method of the DataFrame to insert the data into the newly created table within the SQLite database.\n\n9. **Error Handling**: Throughout the process, the function is prepared to handle any SQLite errors that may arise, ensuring robustness.\n\n10. **Connection Closure**: Finally, the database connection is closed using `conn.close`, ensuring that all resources are properly released. \n\nThis function encapsulates the entire workflow of creating a sample database, from data generation to database population, making it a useful utility for testing and development purposes.",

This class serves as a centralized location for accessing various configuration parameters required by the application, ensuring that they are easily retrievable and maintainable.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon instantiation. Instead, it relies on environment variables to populate its attributes.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to its instantiation. These variables should adhere to the naming conventions and types expected by the application. If an expected environment variable is not set, the class may raise an error or use default values, depending on its implementation.\n\n**Returns:**\n- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides access to its attributes, which represent the configuration settings.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- Upon creation of an instance of the `Settings` class, it utilizes the `BaseSettings` class from an external library to facilitate the loading of environment variables. This base class likely includes mechanisms for parsing and validating the environment variables.\n- The `Settings` class may define specific attributes that correspond to various configuration settings, such as database connection strings, API keys, or feature flags. These attributes are populated based on the values retrieved from the environment variables.\n- The class may also include methods for validating the loaded settings or providing defaults if certain environment variables are not set.\n- The interaction with the `Config` external library suggests that there may be additional configuration management features, such as merging settings from multiple sources or providing a structured way to access configuration data.\n\nThis class is essential for ensuring that the application can be configured dynamically based on the environment in which it is running, promoting flexibility and ease of deployment.",

Instead, it raises an exception if the validation fails.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method first checks the length of the `samples` list. If the list contains fewer than two samples, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that at least two samples are required for comparison.\n- Next, it checks if all samples in the list are identical. This is typically done by converting the list to a set (which removes duplicates) and checking the length of the set. If the length of the set is 1, it implies that all samples are identical, and a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.\n- The method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to enforce these validation rules, ensuring that the input adheres to the expected criteria before proceeding with further computations or analyses.",

It computes the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the regression model, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `None`: This method does not take any parameters directly. It relies on internal data loaded via the `_load_data` method.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The method expects that the data required for regression analysis has been previously loaded and is accessible through the class instance. The data should be structured appropriately, typically as a two-dimensional array or matrix for the independent variables (features) and a one-dimensional array for the dependent variable (target).\n\n**Returns:**\n`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding values:\n- `coefficients`: A list of regression coefficients for each independent variable.\n- `intercept`: The intercept of the regression line.\n- `r_squared`: The coefficient of determination, indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.\n- `p_values`: A list of p-values corresponding to each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of each predictor.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n1. **Data Loading**: The method begins by loading the necessary data using the `_load_data` method, which retrieves the independent and dependent variables for the regression analysis.\n  \n2. **Matrix Preparation**: It constructs the design matrix `X` by stacking the independent variables and adding a column of ones to account for the intercept term.\n\n3. **Coefficient Calculation**: The method uses NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq` function to compute the least squares solution, which provides the regression coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared residuals.\n\n4. **Predictions and Residuals**: It calculates the predicted values by multiplying the design matrix `X` with the computed coefficients.

If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return an empty dictionary, depending on the implementation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`dict`: A dictionary containing the following key-value pairs:\n- `mean`: The average of the numbers.\n- `median`: The middle value when the numbers are sorted.\n- `mode`: The most frequently occurring number(s) in the list.\n- `variance`: A measure of how much the numbers vary from the mean.\n- `standard_deviation`: The square root of the variance, representing the dispersion of the numbers.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the input list to ensure it is not empty.\n- It then utilizes the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library to calculate the mean of the numbers.\n- Next, it employs `np.median` to find the median value.\n- For the mode, the function calls `stats.mode` from the SciPy library, which returns the most common value(s) in the list.\n- The variance is computed using `np.var`, which assesses the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n- Finally, the standard deviation is calculated using `np.std`, providing insight into the spread of the data.\n- All computed statistics are organized into a dictionary and returned to the caller, allowing for easy access to the statistical measures.",

Z-scores are statistical measures that describe a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values, indicating how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. This function leverages the `calculate_z_scores` method from the `StatsService` class to perform the computation.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers for which the Z-scores will be calculated.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The list must contain numerical values, and it is expected that the list has more than one element to compute meaningful Z-scores. An empty list or a list with a single element may lead to undefined behavior or errors.\n\n**Returns:**\n`List[float]`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input data. Each Z-score indicates how many standard deviations each value in the input list is from the mean of the list.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function first validates the input to ensure that it is a non-empty list of floats.\n- It then calls the `calculate_z_scores` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the input data to it.\n- The `calculate_z_scores` method computes the Z-scores by subtracting the mean of the data from each value and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the data. The results are rounded to four decimal places.\n- Finally, the function returns the list of calculated Z-scores, providing a standardized measure of the input data's distribution. \n\nThis function is essential for statistical analysis, particularly in scenarios where understanding the relative position of data points within a dataset is necessary.",

It integrates with the data layer to ensure that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid when compared against the actual data stored in the system. This service is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that operations involving data are valid and reliable.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- **Attributes:** The class does not define any specific attributes in the provided code segment. However, it is expected to utilize instances of the `DataService` class to perform its validation tasks.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `ValidationService` class expects input data that is structured according to the requirements of the specific validation being performed. This may include data models or raw data that need to be validated against existing records in the database. The specifics of the input format are likely defined by the methods within the class.\n\n**Returns:**\n- The class does not return values directly upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods that may return validation results or raise exceptions if the validation fails.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `ValidationService` class relies heavily on the `DataService` to retrieve data from various sources, particularly from SQLite databases. It utilizes the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method from `DataService` to load data into pandas DataFrames, which are then used for validation checks.\n- The class is structured to handle multiple types of validations, likely including checks for data consistency, integrity, and logical correctness based on business rules.\n- When performing validations, the service may compare incoming data against existing records, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met before allowing further processing.\n- If any validation checks fail, the class is expected to raise appropriate exceptions, such as `DataError`, to indicate the nature of the validation failure, allowing for clear error handling and debugging.\n- Overall, the `ValidationService` acts as a crucial intermediary between incoming requests and the data layer, ensuring that all data manipulations are valid and adhere to the defined business logic.",
