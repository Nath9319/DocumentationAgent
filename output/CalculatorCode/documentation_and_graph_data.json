    "documentation": "### create_sample_database() -> None\n\n**Description:**\nThe `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.\n\n**Parameters:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\nThe function does not take any input parameters. It operates with predefined sample data that is generated within the function itself.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone: The function does not return any value. It performs operations that result in the creation of a database and a CSV file.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n1. **CSV File Generation:** The function begins by creating a DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame` method, which contains sample housing data. This DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file using the `df.to_csv` method.\n   \n2. **Directory Creation:** It checks if the directory for storing the CSV file exists using `os.path.exists`. If it does not exist, it creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.\n\n3. **Database Connection:** The function establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`. If the database file already exists, it is removed using `os.remove` to ensure a fresh start.\n\n4. **Table Creation:** A cursor object is created using `conn.cursor`, which is used to execute SQL commands. The function executes a SQL command to create a new table for storing the housing data.\n\n5. **Data Insertion:** The function populates the newly created table with data from the CSV file using the `df.to_sql` method, which facilitates the insertion of DataFrame data into the SQL table.\n\n6. **Error Handling:** Throughout the process, the function is designed to handle potential SQLite errors by catching `sqlite3.Error` exceptions.\n\n7. **Connection Closure:** Finally, the database connection is closed using `conn.close`, ensuring that all resources are properly released.\n\nThis function encapsulates the entire workflow of creating a sample database, from data generation to database population, making it a useful utility for testing and development purposes.",

Instead, it raises an exception if validation fails.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by retrieving the relevant data from a SQLite database using the `self.data_svc.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method. This function call fetches the data necessary for validation.\n- It then iterates through the columns specified in the `payload`. For each column, it checks if the column exists in the retrieved DataFrame.\n- If a column is found to be missing, the method raises a `DataError`, providing a message that indicates which column is absent.\n- For columns that exist, the method further checks whether the data type of each column is numeric by utilizing the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function from the pandas library.\n- If any column is found to be non-numeric, the method raises a `DataError` with a message indicating the specific column that failed the numeric check.\n- The overall flow ensures that only valid and appropriate data is processed for correlation analysis, thereby enhancing the robustness of the application.",
