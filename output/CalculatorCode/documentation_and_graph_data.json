Documentation may be incomplete.\n### create_sample_database() -> None\n\n**Description:**\nThe `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.\n\n**Parameters:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently by generating its own sample data and creating a database.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by checking if a directory for storing the CSV file exists; if not, it creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.\n- It then generates a sample DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame` class, which contains predefined housing data.\n- This DataFrame is saved to a CSV file using the `df.to_csv` method.\n- Before creating the SQLite database, the function checks if a previous database file exists. If it does, it removes the old file using `os.remove` to ensure a fresh start.\n- A new SQLite database connection is established using `sqlite3.connect`, and a cursor object is created to execute SQL commands.\n- The function creates a table in the database to hold the housing data.\n- It then loads the data from the CSV file into the SQLite table using the `df.to_sql` method.\n- Finally, the function closes the database connection with `conn.close`, ensuring that all changes are saved and resources are released. Throughout the process, it handles potential errors using `sqlite3.Error` to maintain robustness.",

These variables should correspond to the configuration attributes defined within the class. The absence of required environment variables may lead to errors or default values being used.\n\n**Returns:**\n- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes its attributes based on the environment variables.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- Upon instantiation, the `Settings` class utilizes the `BaseSettings` class from an external library to load and validate configuration values from the environment.\n- The class likely defines various attributes that correspond to specific settings required by the application, such as database connection strings, API keys, or feature flags.\n- The `Config` class from another external library may be used to provide additional configuration management capabilities, such as validation, type conversion, or default values.\n- The logic within the `Settings` class ensures that all necessary settings are retrieved and can be accessed in a consistent manner throughout the application, promoting better maintainability and reducing the risk of misconfiguration.",

A Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset. This method is useful for standardizing data, allowing for comparison across different datasets or distributions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the Z-scores will be calculated.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `numbers` should be a non-empty list containing numerical values. It is important that the list has at least two elements to compute a meaningful Z-score, as both mean and standard deviation are required for the calculation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`list`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input values. Each Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean of the input list.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations.\n- It then calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean`, which provides the average value of the dataset.\n- Next, it computes the standard deviation using `np.std`, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the dataset.\n- For each number in the original list, the Z-score is calculated using the formula: \n  \\[\n  Z = \\frac{(X - \\text{mean})}{\\text{std\\_dev}}\n  \\]\n  where \\(X\\) is each individual number, \\(\\text{mean}\\) is the average of the numbers, and \\(\\text{std\\_dev}\\) is the standard deviation.\n- Finally, the method returns a list of the calculated Z-scores, allowing users to understand the relative position of each number within the context of the dataset.",

This method provides a statistical range that is likely to contain the true population mean based on the sample data and a specified confidence level.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (e.g., integers or floats) for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.\n- `confidence_level` (`float`): A value between 0 and 1 that represents the desired confidence level for the interval (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `data` should be a non-empty list of numerical values. The list must contain at least two elements to compute a meaningful confidence interval.\n- `confidence_level` must be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will result in an error.\n\n**Returns:**\n`tuple`: A tuple containing two elements:\n- The lower bound of the confidence interval (`float`).\n- The upper bound of the confidence interval (`float`).\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method first calculates the mean of the provided data using the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library.\n- It then computes the standard error of the mean using the `st.sem` function from the SciPy library, which takes into account the sample size.\n- The critical value for the confidence interval is determined using the `st.t.ppf` function, which provides the t-distribution value based on the specified confidence level and the degrees of freedom (sample size minus one).\n- Finally, the method calculates the margin of error by multiplying the standard error by the critical value, and then constructs the confidence interval by subtracting and adding this margin to the mean.\n- The resulting lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval are returned as a tuple.",

This class serves as a foundation for defining various API-related exceptions, ensuring that all exceptions can be handled uniformly.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).\n- `detail` (`str`): A string providing a detailed message about the exception, which can be used to convey specific error information to the client.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically in the range of 100 to 599.\n- The `detail` should be a descriptive string that explains the nature of the error encountered.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone. The constructor initializes the exception instance but does not return a value.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `APIException` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, allowing it to function as a standard exception.\n- Upon initialization, the constructor takes two parameters: `status_code` and `detail`. These parameters are assigned to instance attributes for later use.\n- The constructor then calls the superclass's (`Exception`) constructor with the `detail` message, which sets up the exception message that will be displayed when the exception is raised.\n- This class does not implement additional methods or properties beyond those inherited from `Exception`, but it provides a structured way to handle API errors consistently across the application.",

The specific requirements for each method may vary, but generally, inputs should be:\n- Numeric types (integers or floats) representing monetary values or rates.\n- Positive values for amounts and time periods.\n- Interest rates should be expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).\n\n**Returns:**\nThe methods of the `FinancialService` class return numerical values (floats) that represent the results of the financial calculations performed. The specific return values depend on the method invoked:\n- Future value calculations return the total value of an investment after a specified period.\n- Present value calculations return the current worth of a future sum of money.\n- Payment calculations return the fixed periodic payment amount required to amortize a loan.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\nThe `FinancialService` class utilizes functions from the `numpy_financial` library to perform its calculations:\n- **Future Value (`npf.fv`)**: This function calculates the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate. The class method that calls this function will typically require inputs such as the interest rate, number of periods, and payment amount.\n- **Present Value (`npf.pv`)**: This function computes the present value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.

It validates the input data to ensure that the necessary columns exist and are numeric, and then performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using the validated data. The function returns a summary of the regression results, including coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the independent variables.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the database from which the data will be retrieved.\n- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table in the database that contains the data for regression analysis.\n- `dependent_var` (`str`): The name of the dependent variable (the outcome variable) for the regression.\n- `independent_vars` (`List[str]`): A list of names for the independent variables (predictor variables) used in the regression analysis.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to a SQLite database file.\n- `table_name` should be a string that corresponds to an existing table within the database.\n- `dependent_var` must be a string that matches a column name in the specified table.\n- `independent_vars` should be a list of strings, each representing a column name in the table that will be used as predictors.

The function begins by validating the regression inputs using the `validate_regression_inputs` method from the `ValidationService`. This step ensures that the specified columns exist in the database and are numeric.\n2. If validation passes, the function retrieves the relevant data from the database using the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method, which loads the data into a DataFrame.\n3. It constructs the design matrix `X` by adding a column of ones (for the intercept) to the independent variables and extracts the dependent variable `y`.\n4. The function then performs OLS regression using NumPy's least squares method, calculating the coefficients and residuals.\n5. It computes various statistics, including the mean squared error, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values for each coefficient.\n6. Finally, it calculates the R-squared value to assess the goodness of fit for the model and compiles all results into a summary dictionary, which is returned to the caller. \n\nThis function integrates error handling through the `APIException` class, ensuring that any issues encountered during execution are communicated effectively to the API client.",

This critical value depends on the specified confidence level and the sample size.\n- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the mean, the confidence level, and the calculated confidence interval, which is represented as a list of two values (the lower and upper bounds). \n\nThis function is essential for statistical analysis, providing insights into the reliability of sample estimates in relation to the overall population.",

It provides methods to read data efficiently, ensuring that the data is accessible for further analysis and processing.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\nNone.\n\n**Expected Input:**\nThe class does not have specific input parameters as it is a service class. However, its methods expect specific types of input:\n- For database-related methods, a valid database path (string) and a table name (string) are required.\n- For file-related methods, a valid file path (string) and the appropriate file format (e.g., CSV) must be provided.\n\n**Returns:**\nThe methods of the `DataService` class typically return a `pandas.DataFrame` object, which represents the loaded data. If the data source is invalid or the data cannot be loaded, appropriate exceptions are raised.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `DataService` class utilizes several external libraries, including `os`, `sqlite3`, and `pandas`, to perform its operations.\n- It checks the existence of files or databases using `os.path.exists` to ensure that the specified paths are valid before attempting to load data.\n- For database interactions, it establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`, executes SQL queries to retrieve data, and loads the results into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_sql_query`.\n- The class includes error handling to manage scenarios where the database file does not exist, the specified table is empty, or other database-related errors occur, raising a custom `DataError` exception with informative messages.\n- The methods are designed to be reusable, allowing other services (like `ValidationService` and `StatsService`) to leverage the data loading capabilities provided by the `DataService` class.",
